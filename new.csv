Smartdevices,5,OR,  A really awesome keyboard  i was actually going for the cheap gaming keyboards like the Blaze   but This  it may be a bit costly for most of you all but trust me its worth it  this is the best RGB membrane keyboard ever  It may not be mechanical but do not ever go for the cheap gaming keyboards   this keyboard gives a premium  stealthy look and has alot of game lighting profilesPros  durable  Nice vibrant colors  Nice quality membrane keys   Almost everythingCons   Not many lighting effects   COULD have been a Mechanical keyboard
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I know its costly but its worth your money  Logitech any known branded products LAST LONGer than any random ones   Pros Although its not mechanical  the keys feel very responsive The lights on the keyboard look amazing and CAN be switched off with a hardware button on the keyboard The software perfectly links up with my mouse  which is also Logitech   and feels very seamless Fits great on theAmazonBasics Extended Gaming Mouse PadCons The wrist rest is non removable  which is not a big deal but the material used can will make your wrist sweaty For some reason  the lights on the software keep resetting  noting wrong with the hardware  and always stops when its purple which is funny The media keys do not work with online applications  Like YouTube  Overall  honestly I feel It was worth the full price too  but somehow it was on offer when I was about to order it Thanks Anunay 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I had been contemplating to buy this for a long time  Went through numerous reviews and compared all other products in similar price range on offer  This was the best amongst all that I could review  It was delivered in excellent condition  well packed and timely delivery  I have been using it for over a month now and all is as expected  The RGB lights are well lit and you can change the zone lighting in   zones  There are     types of pulse settings for the lighting  They keys have a nice tactile feel and are broad and we will placed  Works excellent 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  SO   Very very small keys  For fast typers who use both hands to type at once  you will not be able to use it for typing as most of the times two keys will get pressed  SO A BIG NO FOR TYPING WORK    Very good backlight  Many colors  You can not assign any button any color you want  There are a lot of options you can choose from them    Not very suitable for gaming  Again because of small keys    The handrest is not very useful as it is plastic and will make sweating in no time    cheap built for     keyboard  All plastic      only for RBG lightning  Rest everything sucks with this keyboard 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Good to use keyboard while it is new  but it is very difficult not possible to clean it thoroughly  After about   months of usage they keys start to get jammed  I guess if I am able to open and clean all keys then the experience may improve  but that is not possible with this keyboard  Better to go for one of cherry mx keyboards  than this one 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Have always used a Logitech as my keyboard for over    years now and have not looked back since  have used Logitech G    as my entry level gaming keyboard back in      all the way upto G   S for which I added support for my self made train simulation coded in C   back in       also own a wireless Logitech keyboard which I have as a backup and have a multi device Logitech keyboard too which I use for texting on my phone  these keyboards last a good     years that is more than what I require given the fact that I code       hours a day 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The short review  The Logitech G     membrane  Keyboard looks great  feels good  and has a lot of features in combination that are very hard to find in one keyboard  especially an affordable one  Price  RGB  Media Keys   the G logo to match my mouse were my reasons for buying  I expect they will be yours too  If you want a decent quality  affordable  RGB  Gaming membrane keyboard  compare this one and the Corsair K    Buy one  Push buttons and save up for that high end work horse you really want 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Pros  cheaper than most other high end keyboard rgb coloring system very eye catching accented keys key press is unique and makes sound when pressed Windows lock button Braided wire ensures rough usageCons  none reallyPlease buy this if you are playing DOTA CS 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  This is a terrible product by Logitech  I am sad that I spent so much money on it and within   months of purchase the pain has started to come off the keycaps A few keys do not work as they used to when the keyboard was new  I have to press some keys twice before it registers the keystroke This is a really terrible product and I would NOT recommend anyone to purchase it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Pros    Dedicated media keys and Windows toggle switch are a boon for gaming media consumption and during content creation    Key response times are real quick    Spill resistance is a plus   Function keys are programmable   RGB all the way Cons    Palm rest feels plasticky and not suitable for big hands like myself  it is not removable as well    Mecha membrane keys may disappoint mechanical keyboard enthusiasts    Linux compatibility issues    Key markings get rubbed off within first few weeks of use 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  do not think much just buy it  it is best buy for this price point The best keyboard you can buy at this price  do not go for any cheap mechanical keyboards as they can not provide you the experience Logitech stuff can provide  The RGB Lighting is highly customizable with Logitech Gaming Software and different RGB profiles can be made for different applications Pros     Quality of Logitech G series    Highly customizable RGB Lighting    Highly tactile mecha membrane keys    Additional multimedia keys are available    In game mode  selected keys could be blocked Cons     Made of plastic  Could be more sturdy    The RGB zones could have been more smaller and customizable     Of course  it is not mechanical but I would not consider this as I am not paying for mechanical one My last opinion will be if your budget is limited and then just close your eyes and buy it  If you are new to Logitech G series then you will fall in love with it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The best RGB LED keyboard under this price segment  LED sync with G    mouse is very good  Keyboard s button is very tactile and feels great when clicking  Response is very quick  multimedia keys also available which is more helpful for me 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Update      Nov   AVOID if you are gamer  The keys got stuck and need more pressing power and its irritating while playing FPS games  Go for better MX switch keyboard  I just replaced it with Corsair K   and feels a huge difference OLD Comment The keyboard is good for gaming and it feels like you are using MX buttons but has membrane  Soft touch feels good when press Small buttons but easy to use  Synced with mouse 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This keyboard is A M A Z I N G   You can download the Logitech app for free and customise your coloursThe feel is just sensationalThe keyboard is really good and has a nice strong cable too which is long enoughThe colours can be set up for different sectors of the keyboardThe best part of it is it is game mode setting which is really helpfulIt also has volume and mute buttons on it and is very stylishbest keyboard I have ever purchased and is awesome for its price
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   This is a stealA brilliant RGB keyboard for BEGINNERS in gaming  I would reccomend this to all who are thi king to buy a gaming keyboard under        with RGBCOMPETITORS   Cosmic byte  my friend owns one but that does not look that nice but is a mechanical one that too under      but i do not think i will reccomend you cosmic byte  HyperX  A brilliant keyboard but sadly only red backlightingPROS   Logitech G hub customization   Brilliant RGB   Mechanical feel   Palm rest   From a well know brandCONS   Not a mechanical oneAfter  hr of useThis is a superb keyboard for BEGINNERSJust  go for it     
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros   Feels good to type   Build quality is nice  easy media access keys  Keyboard stand is good  Spill proof aswellCons   RGB not providing      customizations   caps num  indication light is very bright than the other keys which may disturbe at night   it is a fairly big keyboad   Matt finish and can get dirty so easly  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I bought this KB for my laptop since i was not happy gaming with the keyboard that came with it  The g    has done a pretty great job so far since I have used it for almost   months now  I specifically wanted a memberane budget keyboard with RGB and this is amazing for my use  As it has been mentioned it is spill proof  I have spilt coffee several times while using and it has not given me any problems since the keycaps are vacuum sealed  Keys can be removed with some effort  This thing is durable enough for the price  If you are looking for a good memberane KB  this is it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Logitech s build quality Most responsive membrane keys I have used   Keys are quick and responsive for typing fast as well as gamingSoftware options for function keys   game mode etc  Subtle RGB with   zones   its very practical for gaming   work and zones do not leak to other parts   see picture RGB options in software Media buttons Lights for caps lock   num lock   scroll lock   game mode   see picture Key caps Braided cable 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Initially got a K    but switched to this  mainly because I am super comfortable with the the key positions on Logitech keyboards  K   has an additional set of keys on the left  which makes intuitive actions like hitting ESC  TAB etc   left most keys  confusing  especially for people who are  used  to a standard keyboard layout Extremely happy with the quality of Logitech G Prodigy G     Lighting matches perfectly with my chassis and mouse  also Prodigy 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  after using it  moths i write this           nice product    build quality is perfect key is awesome     easy to handle         design is also perfect          i experienced the good performance from it     for the budget and entry level this one is perfect compare to other entry level mechanical keyboard      or any brand        so if your budget allow on this price go for it      do not go for the cheap  mechanical because you will get disappointed from those cheap mechanical keyboard    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  It comes with a Braided Cable which is stronger than your non braided cableskeys are actually faster than a normal membrane keyboard and you will feel the difference instantlykey LEDS r bright but brightness cannot be changed from the keyboard itself  you will have to use Logitech Gaming Softwarein the software you can set up macros  and you have a small range of rgb effects which you can customize easilyyou also have Game Mode  Media Keys  and a button for turning LEDs on and offThe build quality is amazing   it looks and feels premiumWrist rest works but is non detachableIt has Anti Ghosting so pressing multiple keys is not an issueOverall Its Worth The Money 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Working fine till now   rgb is good   keys are responsive Review updated     August     Bought in feb      For the past couple of months  left shift key has started to stuck sometimes while pressing  which significantly hinders gaming performance  Emailed Logitech support  they usually reply back in   weeks and they told me to do some basic troubleshooting methods like cleaning and all  which did not solve the issue obviously 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This Keyboard is a perfect balance of reliability  and performance It as actuation force of    g and a  mm of travel distance so key press are smooth and instantly registered  it comes handy in CSGo and other esports the RGB is for the keys only and not backlite but it is not a deal breaker with the Ghub software you can control the RGB lighting al though there are only   patterns it does the trick for me       would recommend 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   RGB is awesome  RGB led is not too much  you will not have any trouble sitting in a dark room watching movie with keyboard lights on  Light shines through the alphabets only so no light spill Keys are good  remember they are rubber dome keys  and they are much better than a normal keyboard  you will feel uncomfortable typing on normal keyboard after using this for a while I do not game a lot      hours a week  but I can assure you that this keyboard is built well  I use them for work a lot  lot more than i do for gaming   those macros can do wonders  I just love the macros 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  PROS     Very comfortable to type and game with  key travel and responses are very good    Good sturdy build    Some youtubers said its quite noisy  but trust me  it is not    The media shortcuts like volume controls  pause and forward buttons work wonders    The lighting according to me is excellent  It is not very flashy and its t dull either    The sweet sounds on the key press  Love it    The palm rest   You can work long hours with this keyboard without getting your hands tired up and aching CONS     The keyboard is a little big than the standard ones    Some people said that it gets worn off after an year of use or so  something to keep in mind that is all i have to say about this keyboard at this point  I would really recommend this product to people who are into typing for long hours or gaming  and have a price constraint of  k bucks 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Had this keyboard for    days now  and I have to say that I am fairly satisfied  The build quality is pretty sturdy  and the keyboard is pretty satisfying to type and game on  Some things I have noticed   The keys are not quite as soft as your usual membrane laptop keyboard  but not as clicky as a mechanical keyboard either   The wrist rest  while hard  is quite comfortable to use  and I have not had any pain or stiffness in my hand after long hours of use   The lighting is not very bright  and does not have any brightness controls  The only control on the board itself is to turn the lights on or off  and any further customization needs to be done via Logitech s G Hub  Another note is that the colors are not near as vivid as on my G    mouse  but that is quite acceptable given the pricing range   The build is pretty sturdy  with minimal deck flex  The braided cable is also a rather nice touch   My only gripe is that the lock key lights are about twice as bright as the keyboard s own backlighting  which does not make much sense Other than that  there is not much else to say  it is a pretty good board at this price point  and at least presently  I would recommend it  I will update this review in case I notice any issues down the line 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is a great keyboard  The keys have the height and travel of the mechanical keyboard  but are super smooth on impact  It kind of gives you best of both sides   mechanical and membrane It has very good RGB lighting under the keys  No light bleed like other cheaper RGB keyboards  Also  the keys are perfectly legible  in white  even when the RGB is turned off I only wish this was a bit cheaper  May be around the      mark  All in all  a great buy 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Works well with my Mac book pro      You need to change the keyboard configarations and get used to the windows key vs command key The keys are soft and there is almost no noise no matter how you hit hard I am not much into the RGB lighting so customisation of the rgb dosent matter to me  I am using this for programming so no issues with that so far 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I was in doubt whether to go for a mechanical keyboard or this one  Happy that I made correct decision  RGB colors are pleasant and the Logitech G hub software is very useful  Someone in their review that mentioned that the keys are stiff which made me think a lot before buying  It might be a problem with that particular keyboard  Typing is very comfortable and requires very little force to actuate 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Awesome product  While buying you should know that it is not mechanical  Keys are very light to touch  Wire is decently long  I do not like the part where you can see the led under the keyboard  It takes away the feel  The hand rest is good but not great and can be a bit uncomfortable at times  Sadly you cannot detach it  Though it depends on person to person  Keys are so light to touch that it is a breeze while typing but can be a bit annoying in games if not used to  I got this product at     k in lighting deal so good deal for me 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Best keyboard ever it is not a mechanical keyboard but it sure feels like one it is worth the price it is built quality is also awesome and it have a lot of colours and patterns you can choose from it even have      macro keys so you can customise them to what you need the skip track and increase decrease volume button are key and this keyboard has them
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is a great Membrane keyboard which efficiently mimics the sound effect of a Mechanical keyboard  Media controls  backlit buttons  and customization are great options to have  you will benefit from the Logitech G Hub software if you have a Logitech mouse also  which eliminated the need of having another software in your PC Laptop Palm rest is good but it will take a lot of space on your table  Logitech reliability factors are a huge bonus  so it is unfair to compare this product with other so called cheap Mechanical keyboards  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The keyboard is a subtle product that reminds you now and then that it has an amazing response time rather wasting around  k inr on wannabe mechanical keyboard go with this keyboard and I assure you that it will not be a let down at all keys are spaced amazingly and happens to have media control buttons as well for quick toggle for mute and unmute and remember that it is a membrane keyboard so do not get ready with your pitchforks out 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Please see the below pros and cons Pros    Good build quality   Color customizarion is present   Keys can be reprogramme   Key shape and alignments and placement of Multimedia are efficientCons    Haptic feedback is there but not like mechanical keyboards though after some days it will be fun to use 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros    Spill and dust proof    Key press is beautiful and responsive just like mechanical keyboard except noisy sound    Logitech software allow you to map the any key to perform any task    Very good touch for keyboard for the price   Durable cableCons    I would like to map keys for specific software on foreground not just games  I did not find option for it    Light are little dim    Big keyboard    Poor packaging   Amazon Prime this is one you Overall  Value for money keyboard for under  k Suggestion A compact keyboard without numeric keys would be awesome 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The keyboard is awesome  But i am deducting   star because you can not fix a specified color on keyboard without the logitech software  Your laptop or pc should have the logitech software installed to get that specific color otherwise it always reboots into default mode   The software must give us the option to change the default light mode in next update maybe  And also its a little bit expensive   
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The keyboard itself is fine when used as a normal keyboard but there is no need to pay a premium price for this when we can not control keyboard key brightness Logitech G Hub software is an utter disappointment in its own  It has half baked features and it is unable to consistently sync lights between G    and G     both start with same color and after sometime both will be displaying different colors It is even more frustrating that there is almost no information on internet regarding above mentioned points 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   this keyboard  at first seemed expensive but once i started using  everything changed  its really good  the RGB lights are nice and bright  i really love how the texture feels  I am sure its going to go away after usage but for now  really enjoying the touch and feel of the entire keyboard 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Great keyboard for gaming  works well with CS GO  fortnite and pretty much every single game  The      million colors give you tons of options to customize   zones of the keyboard   never spilt water over it however I would not recommend doing that even if it is spill proof   it feels like a mechanical keyboard honestly  totally worth the buck to get on sale for      if higher please go for something else as some good mechanical keyboards are available for            the mecha dome switches by Logitech give you a good typing experience as well  however you can not change or customize the keycaps and remember it has in built media keys which work on everything Spotify  Netflix and even youtube you can sit back and enjoy   it is well illuminated in the dark and in the day it is just visible  only the alphabets have RGB  it does not have a backlight   you get   years warranty on it so that is another plus factor  inclination of   to raise the height it is almost     kgs even though it is made of plastic  it has an anti slip grip and it has minimal deck flex if ur a key smasher overall it is best for all purposes only downside is the wrist rest as it is not detachable however the wrist rest is pretty clean on it  it does take alot of desk space so check the product dimensions before buying it
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought this gaming keyboard at       INR you can definitely at a lower price during the sale  I order this product on  th Feb at        INR and it is was going to deliver on   th Feb after two days the price dropped to       INR and I got the product on the   th Feb only  Anyway  this keyboard is amazing it is not mechanical it is a membrane keyboard Now you will ask what is the difference between mechanical and membrane keyboards Mechanical keyboards provide much more direct feedback to the user  While a membrane key cap presses down on a thin membrane layer  to a conductive circuit underneath  a mechanical keyboard has spring loaded switches instead But I like it if the product is good then I do not care if it is mechanical or membrane  It is really good for gaming and daily use  But I do not know why anyone will buy this for daily use 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Amazing Product from Logitech at       First of all the RGB is really sick with   light effects and also you can adjust the lighting speed  Secondly the Palm Rest which makes this keyboard looks a manly thing  Then the keystrokes are so smooth and the key stroke sounds soothes your ears  I play games on this keyboard e g  Warzone  Apex and some other story games also I use for work  Love this product  Also it has game mode and in keyboard music control keys  Just buy it you will definitely love it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I did not go for the mechanical carbon rgb because you can hardly feel any better using that plus it doest have wrist rest media keys and the sick rgb on off switch so this is ideal and more value for money and trust me if you think that will last longer you are right but some more advanced and awesome new trend keyboards will come out and you will upgrade for sure   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Reading all the review down below will confuse you definitely      But one thing i can assure this is the best product if you need passthrough light in a keyboard       Customisation you can do is a ton    you have many features      After    days of hard usage i can not even find a small mistake  or glitch aor any allingment issues     In this budget it is damn worth it       You can go for it BLINDly    Detailing in the cable is next level     And very strong braided cable  its like a wollen rope that strong when compared to normal braided cable      I suggest it to people coz i already used reddragon corona lots of bugs   ant e sports rgb keyboard with lots of lightning issues   zebronics transformer dosent have pass through light    But half the price        So i suggest this g    is the best
Smartdevices,3,OR,  after  yr  of use left shift key has become very stiff  it is has become very hard to press  tried cleaning it with no success 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  If you cannot afford a mechanical keyboard this is a good alternative for your gaming setup Except for RGB and Logitech brand name  I did not see a huge difference compared to normal keyboard with big buttons  not sure what its called   non chicket   It does give a premium look to your gaming setup  I trust Logitech  I think it will last for many years 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The keyboard is good but after more than two months using it I am experiencing the  A  alphabet key glitching out  The key often does not register the keystroke and sometimes registers two impressions with just one keystroke  I have used all sorts of logitech devices  mouse  headphones  etc  none of them have given any issues as of yet but this one is surely glitching out in just two months of using this product 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This keyboard is excellent in every sense but it will not function until operating system loads Logitech proprietary software which is a bit buggy and heavy needs to run in background for this keyboard to work I do know whether the Linux support exists or not so Linux users please check before buy 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  It is a great keyboard  People want the  Mechanical feel  but this is just a membrane keyboard and it does more than what is required of it  It is a great keyboard for  k and has everything you require of a gaming keyboard  But the lights are a bit dim in daylight and the font is weird but the keyboard is a solid build and works great with its logitech software 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Considering this keyboard is a membrane keyboard  it still feels great to type on  and I enjoy typing on this keyboard  This is not even close to an actual mechanical keyboard  but if you are somebody who can deal with a membrane keyboard  I would say go for it The lights are great  They are not too bright and obnoxious  rather pleasant  The keyboard has   zone lighting which can be controlled through the G Hub software and has a fair amount of lighting options The extra keys help a ton  after using them  I do not think I will be able to go back to a keyboard without atleast a volume button of some sort Build quality is solid and I am not worried about breaking this thing  the keys are also durable  so far no problems Now the flaw  This keyboard has fixed plastic armrest which cannot be removed whatsoever  It is a single piece  It is not a problem for me personally considering my circumstances  but please take this into consideration before buying the keyboard  The armrest itself takes up around        of the width of the keyboard  around  cm  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The sturdy build quality  the amazing RGB lighting  the integration with the Logitech G software  the multimedia controls  the tactile response  the smooth typing experience  the general comfort of the palm rest and the aesthetic of it all is just perfect  This is a beautiful keyboard for people who like playing FPS RPG games on a semi pro level  and is very useful for people in the creative field  as you can customize macros and keys to function the way you want them to 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  And Yesssss  this is what  i was looking for  Perfect Keyboard  Worth every penny  Best part is you can control the keyboard light by using logitech software  You can easily download it from the official website of logitech Coming to the built quality I would say  Awesome  Believe me  when you touch the keyboard for the first time  You will easily get it  how is the built quality USB cable and wire  you will never find this kind of strong and good quality USB cable in other keyboard Well  this keyboard is not exactly mechanical keyboard  But feels like same Believe me this keyboard is 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Damaged shipping box and wrong product    totally unsatisfied to see that cheating with me    incredible    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is my first gaming keyboard and i have to tell you that this thing is heavy for a keyboard  and it has a large chin which is good for resting your arm  it is awesome and currently i am typing this review using this keyboard  it has an option to turn off the backlight and also to turn off the gaming mode   which is great because if i feel like coding then i will switch off the gaming mode   and if my mood changes i can just press a button to go to game mode  and another button to turn on the backlight and continue to game  built quality is excellent   just go for it 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  i say it is great in terms of look but in terms of performance somewhere it lacks the precision and feedback this is a membrane keyboard so you can expect key sticking sometimes when not pressed in center and all that but overall great product  good for enthusiast gamers  not for pros 
Smartdevices,5,CG,   The keys feel so nice The response time is actually noticibly faster The LEDs could have been brighter  there should be more options for lighting settings on the Logitech Gaming Software  and the WASD keys should have separate lighting The palm rest is great
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Competing against mechanical keyboards  value for money  RGB can be customized via itself Logitech RGB Controller Software  Full Size Keyboard Blue Button  Good Gaming Experience  Go for it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  People who all want this keyboard for gaming can buy this  I had played many gaming like Fortnite and  v  LOL And this keyboard is perfect for these games  And you have to search for the software in internet fir changing the  RGB  They did not include the software link in Amazon Pros Comfortable KeysHard and sturdyIt is a water and dust resistence keyboard Media keys are included which is not include in many keyboardsCons The space bar is little bit inclined No deatachable arm rest 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Ammazing performance also i do like silent keyboards because mechanical one s make sound which the mic detects and it is herd in gamesWhere as this keyboard gives almost mechanical response fast and accurate with less noiceIn games like csgo it helps in gathering important intel and the keys are also durable and lifted wich i love the most overall amazing keyboard and due to its software it helps me to customise my color scheme
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Not being actually Mechanical but feels very close to mechanical with impressive feedback  actually better than cheap mechanical  Its a LOGITECH product  so durability is top notch with   years of warranty  unlike   year on others brands providing mechanical keys at this price  Built quality is feels cheap  but not the keys  Keys are buttery smooth with  mm of high travel  Typing experience is great  If you are searching for a overall good keyboard to last longer  its a great choice  But if you want a keyboard just for gaming  better to go for mechanical key at this price range 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Well  the exterior build quality is good but the keyboard is basically unusable for me since some keys are unresponsive   delayed input  missed completely and sometimes multiple registers for single click  Very disappointed and since it is only   day return policy by amazon I need to contact Logitech and see if I can get a replacement  I should have fought this issue earlier but initially I thought I am not typing right since it is my first time using mechanical like keyboard Expect a better quality control considering high price 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  One of the better keyboards with RGB  The control software is a bit iffy but when it works  it works like a charm  Can create app specific profiles  The colour customisation is on a group Leven and not on per key basis
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I have used it for   years and sold it on olx outta sheer frustration  price is the issue here       rupees here  sometimes even       for that money you can get a compact    keyless design with better rgb illumination and better build quality not to mention far better aesthetics  it is like Logitech is charging for the brand name which is not really a huge brand in the first place 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This keyboard is good for typing as well as gaming    It gives mechanical keyboard experience whereas the keyboard is membrane type though its very user friendly and helps in gaming as well  The sturdiness of the keyboard is very good as its built quality     And the cord is also durable and of premium quality 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  This keyboard looks amazing but after using the keyboard for  two days  keys became little tough and the next day keys are very hard to press  and also rgb keyboard brightness keeps on decreasing  The letters on keys went on fading  This is very disaapointing
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Absolutely love it  Setting up the lights with the software is amazing as it gives you so many options to choose from  Taps are really responsive and just the right amount of soft  The gaming mode button is of immense help for gaming purposes  of course 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Writing the review after     years of Usage  Keyboard stops working  i have to change port   unplug and plug again  Light is on but keys stop responding  Tried many solutions but no  its very irritating  i have to keep changing ports until it starts working  Never expected this from Logitech
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   This keyboard is a great keyboard      It is a semi mechanical keyboard    I liked it very muchBut there was a Problem at start      it used to make beep sound through my speaker     But then I figure it out   If you are suffering from the same problem just plug the USB cable into another USB portThe RGB lights should be more intensive    it is sort of dim   but not bad
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Awesome product  was packed well and arrived without any issues  Key placement and feedback is perfect  The lights do not distract and has the right amount of brightness by default 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Beast in budget  Buttons r well lit in dark  More control via logitech gaming hub app  Its very sturdy  Can set light options and also sync to other Logitech products
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome keyboard which is perfect for gaming Keys feels like mechanical keys and are very responsive RGB software is good for customization First recieved a defective product in which few keys were not working  Amazon gave the replacement in   days New replacement working flawlessly Good job amazon 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I bought this with  logitech G    mouse   Chroma lighting in this price   quality of logitech is good  custom lighting feature give perfect match for any gaming setup and colour skim  Keys are properly placed customisation software is pretty easy to understand and easily match lighting with other chroma lighting products of Logitech 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Love this keyboard so much  Its so bright and pretty I just wish you got more options on logitech gaming software like pick rhe lights for individual keys etc  But i guess paying  k for a keyboard is still not enough to get simole features like that  It does not matter too much tho since the keyboard is really pretty 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Decent quality for the price  however you ll not get the satisfaction of the mechanical or cherry mx or brown keys  a bit heavy which is gud  build quality is gud all plastic  one thing irritates  it attracts skin oil on the keys so keep a rubbing alcohol or cleaner close by  also blacklighting is bright enough n you can customize thru pc 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very Bad Product in this price range   first i have notice the build quality is very very poor its cheap plastic material my     keyboard is better then this keyboard 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Love this keyboard  I do not have much experience with gaming keyboards  but this one is great to use  The keys have great feedback Although there is one thing I hope was present  ability to specify a color using Ubuntu I had to install Windows to configure the color of the key light The best thing is definitely the ability to choose from millions of colors  Gives the keyboard a personal feel 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  it is a decent keyboard with color changing backlights on keys  can be fixed to single color or turned off   I was expecting this to improve typing speed   but the keys are too near to each other   does not feel comfortable and easy to type on 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Typing is a pleasure on this keyboard  Makes less sound than a mechanical keyboard which is the primary reason I bought it  RGB colors are good but I do not use them 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  This keyboard does not have Romer G keys  its just a membrane keyboard  There is no proper description about the type of keys  I bought this thinking it has Romer G keys and it is non refundable  They only give you replacement 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is a moderately weighty and sturdy keyboard  made entirely of plastic  Software controlled rbg  the rgb works in sections and not individual keys  Moderately bright in a well lit room  I am a casual gamer and I did find a significant increase in response speed  Overall a good entry level rbg branded keyboard  I would rather go for a logitect rbg than a Chinese one 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is not mechanical but feels bery good to type  Very slick design  Nice lighting  Paired with Logitech mouse  looks awesome Overall very nice product  I feel like this is better than the mechanical keyboards available at this price point 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The quality of the plastic is not equal to price   And it have only   lighting effects  But cosmic byte keyboard has   lighteffect in the price of       Then why I choose this
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Tactile feedback is sufficiently good  KB is slightly expensive but you get what you pay for  it feels heavy and made with good material compared to some cheaper brands  I have been using it for gaming and general usage for past   months not and have no issues whatsoever 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Honestly  best purchase I have made on amazon  The lights were fantastic although could be brighter  The keys were extremely responsive and comfortable  It sort of felt like a mechanical  the bottom grip is perfect and so is the stand  the software is easy to use and provides lots of features  the wire was a nice size  was thick and braided  keys were sturdy  arm rest is nice  and is very satisfying to use  Great product for the price  went above and beyond my expectations 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Excellent product  soft membrane feels like a mechanical keyboard without the click  Over priced though  that is the only reason for   stars  Should be priced at about    k
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Pros     Build quality is premium   RGB Lightning is well balanced across all the keys    Easily customize RGB using Logitech G Hub software  If you already have Logitech RGB Mouse then you can easily sync both the devices for same RGB Mode Cons    Little overpriced  Look out for discount    RGB Lightning s brightness is not controllable  Default lightning is not much bright anyway so it will not hurt your eyes Conclusion it is a Logitech hardware  It will not disappoint you  Just go for it    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The product is totally as advertised   It has a nice clicky feel and the feedback is quite good   The RGB lighting is quite satisfying but can be a bit dull under well lit condition Only caveat is the profile set by Logitech software is not saved into the keyboard   You have to keep you Logitech software on to keep the profile 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Its an awesome gaming keyboard with rgb lighting and has    function keys which can be functioned using logitech software   the lighting is good and the ergonomics is good with very smooth and buttery buttons and the cable is braided and very strong and the packing and delivery was good with amazon   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is a quality board for gaming that is better than some mechanical boards i have used  it is a membrane design with sliders to give feedback like a Mech board  The lighting can also be synced with your mouse if you have a Logitech mouse I have the G     and it looks pretty cool  The added palm rest is also appreciated for a long gaming session 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Firstly I say very big thanks to  mysterydealz  twitter page  Where there were recommended to me this on big billion days and it came to me at just        only  that was very short period deal  because of that page i got it at very low priceVery big thanks to  mysterydealz 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The product is all well and good  it is semi mechanical which is exactly what I wanted but with mechanical feel  The only thing I am highly disappointed at isThe Logitech g hub software The software is extremely buggy thus not letting you light up the keyboard I am fed up with the software and it is very very annoying 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Build quality is pretty good  Nice clickable responsive buttons  wish it could feel like mechanical one but i am overall satisfied 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good response good quality and the wire is so good But for gaming its gives a little difference from normal keyboards   If you r a hardcore gamer and need a tactile and  ms response then go for the mechanical keyboards If you r a normal user then its really nice
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Absolutely awesome I know there are lot  cheap keyboard available with same features which may look better than this But trust me  it is not  It is far better than all of those When you use it with Logitech software  it enables you with customize lighting     programmable keyboard function  along with many features for specific games It had also palm rest pad No cons found by me till now  Must buy for gamer 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I recommend going without palm rest or keyboard where we can detach it  apart from that rest everything is super good 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This Product is just amazing especially for fortnite people   this keyboard is quick in response time   i mean this keyboard is just so good but the issue that i had was i could not clean between the keys so   i had to buy a key cleaner but Yeah this is logitech G always good products   love for you guys 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is a great gaming keyboard may the best membrane keyboard with nice key press feel and the rgb looks dope  Also the response time is  ms which is awesome
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Mmm this does catch a lot of sweat a lot faster not a rubber dome btw but I like it nice rgb logitech sync and software is smooth
Smartdevices,5,CG,  all the keyboards i ever had were not comfertable and this one was just amazing  iv been using this for almost a year now and had no key breaks and the sound of the keyboard is also very satisfying  I recommend buying this and it is good for gaming 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  While the keyboard is awesome  This review is for the seller  The box was broken and some of the keys where non functional  Beware of the seller One of the best gaming keyboards I have used      for the product Seller rating should be       
Smartdevices,4,CG,  it is been around   months i am using this keyboard for cs go  it works fine for gaming  but it is not that good for touch typing as a mechanical keyboard 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Overall this keyboard is a win for the money you are paying  it offers you RGB not the best but its good  Media buttons hand rest good quality keys and build quality  So just buy it   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  a drainage hole is missing otherwise it is best The quality is awesome Feels so premium Lights are fun  Blindly go for it  you will get a feeling of mechanical keyboard while using it Best in it is price range 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Got it for  k  Probably the best non mechanical keyboard at that price  Macros can be easily assigned with the Logitech Gaming software  Only con is that colours can not be mapped to individual keys  but it is hard to expect at this price  Overall  it is worth the price 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Apart from the bit awkward position of the backslash key this keyboard is a real gem  it is a mechanical keyboard with lots of configuration options  The backlighting color options and the configurable lighting effect are just amazing 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  If you are not bad on budget buy mechanical instead  as a hardcore gamer my keyboard use is obviously vigorous and sometimes the keys do not react properly But its damn good for its price
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice tactile keys  Can control the lights colour Quality Keyboard 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Looks clean  the backlights are sealed so it does not comes out from under the keys making it look very decent and clean  works perfectly  response time is good  built quality is great   No lag complains  Go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is my first experience using a gaming keyboard and it is great for beginners like me  I suggest you to go for it and after all it is Logitech    
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I will advise everyone to test the all the buttons of the keyboard  In my case the the button   in the horizontal number pad requires multiple taps The basic functionality of even a Rs    keyboard is that all of its button must work at same pressure 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Worth for money  got it for  k during sale  please look into positive reviews and clean your keyboard time to time and have funPS  I am using Logitech G    mouse and Z    speakers and they both are amazing  Thanks logitech for such great products 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The product is good but the pack of mechanical is a problem at sometimes    And the ergonomics does not suit for me    Fyi the pam pad is not removable    That was a downer for me  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have to double or sometimes triple keys to register them  There is ghosting except that I am not even typing rapidly  Real annoyance as passwords get entered incorrectly Too bad I opened the box too late and missed the return period 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The n letter gets pressed     times 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Ordered this one after my Asus Cerberus Keyboard failed in  after   months of usage Logitech G    offers great keystroke feedback If anyones not a fan of mechanical keyboards but need a good membrane keyboard with good enough perfomance  go with this one 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Man this is really a good keyboard  The extra space they give to rest your hands is quite good  And the rgb system works well  it is good when you can control the lights  And it even has game mode which allows you precision in game  Worth it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The space bar was disfunction after exactly one month  Other keys then start to get problematic and writing this review is a pain in the ass   sigh my luck
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is Not Like Other Gaming Keyboards it has a minimalist look and it is not so flashy and does not hurt your eyes like other Keyboards   I like These kind of Keyboards  The Star Feature is the customizable Led Backlighting Which Most Of the Other Gaming Keyboards Lack 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Pretty good build quality  more than enough RGB customisations    spill proof  beautiful to look at however  the keys have a soft feedback and not as tactile if you are coming from a laptop
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Feels very durable and keys are a delight to type on Backlighting is amazing Looks rugged and beautiful at the same time 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am not big fan of extreme RGB and wanted to have some which adds coolness to my desk and this suits better than i expected  Go far it  Best product but should be priced around     
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great RGB keyboard with great price  Braided cord ang mutiple lighting effect via software  A very good product from logitech
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent product  Worth the price  if the price is more then  k just wait for any offer event  It will decrease  But you will love this keyboard for sure
Smartdevices,5,CG,  For the price to performance ratio  nothing comes close  The button feel is awesome 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  worst experience   i nvr thought this gona happen   after   days right window key is not working  and  you shut down the pc using alt f   nothing happen when you press this   keys       feeling very bad i spent  k on this shit 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Very good product I would have given  stars but one thing the brightness cannot be adjusted on keyboard it can only be done in software if some keyboard pre set was given it would be great
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Worth the money  Although it is not a mechanical keyboard but it will not let you down while gaming  You can make multiple changes for light setting and many other stuff  At this price point go for it 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Not easy to type on  Made a mistake buying this  Keyboard layout not well spaced  Keys get hard 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I was expecting better product for the money i have spent  Resposne time is poor for this price range   Backlit is even bad  I do not recommend this product  Not worth the money 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Yeah the light is a bit low bt as you people know that its not a mechanical keyboard White light is  blueish  bt nt white   that is a bit disappointment bt does not matter at all 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  This keyboard is great but I am facing issue with the  D  key  The  D  key sometimes does not respond and I caught this issue while playing CS GO  Hope amazon will replace the keyboard 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Paying      for this keyboard and keys are not working    Though this keyboard might be good but the seller is so meh that he did not even check if it is working or not and sending it to the customers like ehhhhh 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Excellent product by logitech and crushing competition hard it had   zone rgb but i would give it   star if rgb would be more bright
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Got this keyboard at an amazing discount during the Big Sale   Worth it for an intermediate gamer   
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good product but clicks are too light makes huge noise  Razer keyboards are still better than this but expensive than this also  I will say for this much of money its the best keyboard 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Been using it for a short time though but started to like it a lot  It syncs well with my g    and keys feel very tactile  Great budget key board  Go for it blindly 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The serial number on the box DOES NOT matches with the serial number on the product   Beware of the seller   May face issues in warranty related stuff  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I always wanted to buy this one  Although there are mechanical keyboards available in this range but   This one is just love   It really does not matters that its a membrane keyboard 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is comfortable enough for me  It has a classic and simple look to it  Just beautiful
Smartdevices,5,CG,  according to me  these are the value for money keyboard if any one looking for this budget  I would strongly recommend this keyboard for you guys 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is Logitech  so it is awesome  Unboxed it  connected  installed the software and wolla its all setup with games and music  Great quality and worth every penny 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am using this for my daily office work  typing is very easy and fast  value for money 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  keyboard is nice but led brightness is low
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice Product  Very good durability  If you can not afford a mechanical keyboard this one is as good as one  But it is a membrane keyboard  Great value for money  Very good gaming performance 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Was hard choosing between this and alternatives from other companies  But went with the brand Logitech as I have never been disappointed with their products before  Made the right decision 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Been using this keyboard since   years now  having   small issue  The black polish on the keyboard comes off after an year  but that is not a big deal  Works perfectly fine  all keys are still perfect 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   After    days Capslock indicator is not lighting up but capslock function workingI do not know but I did not expect this from logitech
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Outstanding product   loving it   Iam a hardcore programmer  And it is made my typing a lot more easier   love to work in it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Cool look little bit pricy but over all good to use gaming and coding
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I love it because it has good enough light effects and customization It also does not make so much sound while playing even because its membrane anyways 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  A premium membrane keyboard with mechanical keyboard feel    with brilliant rgb effects

Smartdevices,5,CG,  The keyboard is excellent in terms of build it is heavy and as well as the keys are of excellent quality and the RGB on the keyboard looks so great and beautiful 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Bruh go for itThe best part in this keyboard is the space key and is just dam satisfiying to typeU can customise the keyboard in   different colours
Smartdevices,5,CG,  i have been using it for coding arround like two weeks  so far so good  the keys look sturdy  One point to note is that this is a Membrane Keyboard  No cherry red keys or mechanical keys
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This product is so good but do not mechanical keyboard anyway wish you my money
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great keyboard by Logitech  Great Quality
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Slightly overpriced according to me   not a mechanical keyboard but feels like the mechanical keyboard    Rgb works superbly which is customizable

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Hello Guys  I have bought this keyboard almost a month ago  it is an awesome one I will give you a short  but in depth review First off  Be sure to register your product s warranty on their website listen inside the box Also download the software for RGB Customization and also to program the  F      Keys  Also  the software helps you add many other awesome features let us run through the Pros and Cons  Pros    Awesome Clicky Membrane Keys  Great Lighting  In Built media controls help a lot   Hand Rest is dope Cons    The keys are finished in a  rubbery sticky  coating  which attract fingerprints and are hard to clean For the price I bought it for         Cloudtail Seller  it was a steal you will love it xD
Smartdevices,1,CG,   st Month   VERY GOOD nd Month   GOOD  Month  Two Buttons  A Q  became hard to press th Month  More than    buttons became hard to pressUsually at least   year life expected but this keyboard is very worst only it could perform   months as good  If you want to replace keyboard for every   months  then only this is goodProblem    Drivers Keep on crashing every     days on Windows         Money is HUGE for this product
Smartdevices,4,CG,  All the good points about the keyboard are as others have already pointed out  I will not re write them here  However  once issue I am facing is that the wrist rest is at a steep angle  and it is slippery  My wrists keep sliding off  Also the wrist rest is non removable  so I can not replace it with a comfortable wrist rest 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  If you are looking for a  clicky click  noise maker look elsewhere  This keyboard has got   LED backlighting   Nice feel membrane keys  no mechanical keys    Software support to configure the LED colorsSo this is your professional entry level LED gaming keyboard without the mechanical switches  It also has a few extra media keys that you might find useful at times  Overall  a good non mechanical gaming keyboard from Logitech 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  good looks  great variation in colour  easy to use software  romer g fast switches  a little money over budget gaming keyboards   but this smooth mechanical keyboard is surely fast   recommended for csgo  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is a very nice keyboard  though it is a membrane keyboard  The game button can be programmed to lock many keys other than windows keys windows keys are locked by default   The main feature is the beautiful RGB lighting  which has many modes and settings configurable through the driver software overall I found it best  cuz I hate mechanical keyboards for gaming Go for it if you love RGB like I do It also media keys for all media functions like play  pause  stop  next   mute  etc 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Though i could not get a proper mechanical keyboard in this price having cherry mx switches i decided to give it a try as i trust logitech  Turns out its an awesome keyboard  pretty big and strong with sexy matte finish  Wrist wrest is great but would have been good if they had option to remove it  The rgb lightning is great when controlled by the logitech software  Love it now will update if any fault shows up  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  LED Light are not consistant when you look closer  I loved the product Logitech never let us you down but thought buyers should know about this 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Assume Keyboard From Logitech  Best For Games   Normal User  Also Spill Proof  Also Increase My Typing Speed UpTo      We Can Also Control LED Light Speed  I Love To PlayCounter Strike Condition ZeroNeed For Speedgrand theft autoMortal KombatOutlastForzaAsphalt
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Awesome keyboard  The different type of effects in color are really amazing  Just go for it Key press is little bit hard else      value of money  Fully braided cable for longitivity of cable many different color you can choose for set of different keys really awesome keyboard in night looks awesome and no need of extra light at night you will understand how good it is only when you use it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good look and feel     Just love it  It can be on the expensive side but it is totally worth it  If you have the budget  just go for it you will not be disappointed 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  If you want a flashy keyboard  go with this  But if you want a better feel  buy a mechanical keyboard as this is only a membrane keyboard  But even though being a membrane keyboard  the button presses feel quite good  The build quality is top notch and the LED backlighting is amazing  Also  you get sound control buttons on the keyboard which come very handy  Overall  a very good buy 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  It is a great keyboard and I being a dome key lover over mechanical switch would definitely recommend this keyboard to gamers  It is spill resistent too which is great if you are clumsy like me xD
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent keyboard  No complains at all  People complain that this product is overpriced but instead I think it is under priced  You are getting a gaming keyboard with some pretty cool features and it looks better than most other keyboards out there  Highly recommended  Just go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very nice and tactile keyboard   Lighting effects are awesome   Very good purchase
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great keyboard Has braided wire  keys feel great and responsive  it is a membrane keyboard   although feels like mechanical  I personally play CSGO  Mad Max and Assasin s Creed    and more  with it  Works great I personally like the feel of the keys a LOT The Logitech software let us you customise the RGB effects My advice Go for it    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Keys were hard and not mech feeling when new  Actuation strength drops with use  and now is quite tactile  RGB  zones  not individial  looks great  All round great value 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Pros   Very good build quality   sturdy   comfortable due to palm rest  better speeds than normal keyboardsCons   keys are little noisy
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome product  One day delivery in Bangalore  No complains 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Good product good for gaming
Smartdevices,5,OR,  A must Buy  Logitech is a international brand  I have many products of Logitech  c    webcam   I got this keyboard just from Amazon for      a few days before and man i was amazed  Worth the money 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I love this keyboard    I would recommend to boy 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  it is good  no trouble whatsoever nice anti ghosting  good for fps 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  More than expectations
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good mechanical keyboard
Smartdevices,3,OR,  This is NOT a mechanical keyboard  Do not think it is    the keyboard is fine  but bit over priced for being a simple membrane keyboard also it does not have the option of single keystrokes lighting on or off during typing 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Logitech has set a good standard when it comes to gaming peripherals  and the G    is no different  Very good materials and build quality overall  a little lightweight and some flex but it is an all plastic keyboard so that is forgivable  The mecha membrane switches are just okay  can not really compare them to mechanical mx switches  the actuation force is similar but feels heavier than cherry mx  Like most membrane keys  bottoming out the keys feels really mushy  no tactility to speak of  RGB is very nice but not too bright  The keys start to get shiny after about a month of use  this can be expected and is not a huge deal  The wrist rest is okay  you need to tilt the keyboard up on its feet to take advantage of it  The multimedia keys are a decent addition  Everything considered this is a very good keyboard  backed up by the warranty of Logitech  I would give     stars and recommend this product to those on a tight budget  although I had no issues gaming  pros should give this a hard pass 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros    Has RGB lighting    Mech Dome keys are great  Feels like mechanical    Comfortable wrist rest    Macro customisation    Has anti ghosting matrix         value for money  Cons    Not a fully mechanical keyboard    Made up of plastic feels nice though 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The keyboard is sturdy and looking very good and cool  After syncing with g    they look awesome  If only overwolf supported this keyboard  it would have been a   star rating 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Was skeptical to get this keyboard as the reviews were low in Amazon in  but amazon com had some decent reviews and purchased it with the local dealer  Absolutely loving the keyboard  it has the right balance between the mechanical keyboards and the typical rubber dome keyboards  hits the sweet spot for me  Nice feedback as well  Multimedia keys are a big plus  Moving to rgb it is very nice and has plethora of customisations via software  being software I wish logitech adds more customisation in the future   a bit on the costly side but worth every bucks spent
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Does not work after a few months  They keys get jammed  and there is no way to clean them  At this price  considering that Logitech does not provide any support  you are better of buying some cheap knock off mechanical keyboard at      odd rupees that will last more than this garbage Stay away from Logitech in general 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Pros It has mechanical kind of of feel while typing  Good for typing   GamingLove the sound of the key switches while typing The backlight is proper not too dark not too brightBuild is really good  Plastic  also the cable is braided so will last long enoughCons I wish the pad rest would have been a bit biggerthe keys feel a little smaller but not worries it just a matter of getting used too with timeOverall recommended buy      Cheap yet Awesome
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is one of the best affordable keyboards  The keys feel premium along with the build quality  I really like the RGB Colour changing property which is always a plus for these  Whosoever saw this keyboard  said WOW  in the first go itself  Must go for it for all keyboard lovers 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Just loved the audio visualization effect   If you are a music lover  you will loved it    Basically  I buy it for programming  and it totally satisfied me       And sorry I can not say anything on gaming performance  because i did not play games 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Dnt buybutytons will jam after    days   i bought   same model keyboard   
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The sound was so loud that I could hear it through my headphones  so annoying  I ordered a replacement and I hope there will not be the same problem  The keyboard feels good though 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is my first expensive keyboard so I do not have much knowledge to compare to  but this is a great keyboard quality and functionality wise  I am absolutely happy 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Quality is amazing  Keyboard keys are very decent  RGB lights are very sick with amazing effects  Must buy logitech over any other brand bcos they have good after sales service 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros     The keyboard has a premium feel to it when compared to what is available in the Indian market    The RGB Lighting is just bright enough for it be used and not get your attention  though there is no dimming function  you can always increase the darkness of the color to dim the brightness Cons     As the lighting is zoned  a particular zone s light bleeds out to other zones if the other zone s lighting is turned off    The keys feel almost the same as regular membrane keyboards if not slightly better Do not particularly save up for something like this  If you are planning to save  go for the mechanical ones from aliexpress if Cherry MX is out of your range Logitech seems to be the only company in India that has kept their pricing similar to the rest of the world  Most of the companies have prices way above than what they sell their products for in countries like you S    For that reason  you do not have much of a choice when it comes to reputable companies to pick from  Although  there are small companies with their average product in the Indian market with competitive pricing  but I do not think they can touch Logitech when it comes to quality 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I have bought it   week ago and was worried about the purchase trust it is a good budget keyboard  in real it looks amazing all keys works well   JUST GO FOR IT AMAZING KEYBOARD
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using this for the past   yrs and this is working great  No jamming problems even after this much time  The keyboard is great you should go for it  D
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Best gaming keyboard for a starter gamer like me it is a very excellent keyboard and at a good price
Smartdevices,5,CG,  So far so good it is working very effectively flawlessly    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  So Good for gaming there is two custom buttons one is for the lights to turn on and off and the other for switching mode   there are two different modes  gaming and normal   also if you download the logitech software this is going to  beat other keyboards ever Razer keyboards    just type logitech software you will find it in the internet    you can get the lighting effects to change in rainbow colours make your custom colours  too    I hope this helped you thanks   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The best typing experience and gaming experience for   k  ihave ever seen  it is the best i its range
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Buy from here https   amzn to  b   MJ
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Gaming Its a freaking beast I was a cherry mx user but it was stolen Had to switch to this  and honestly it feels almost the same Its a bang for the buck
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Good key board but limited RGB customisation options   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome keyboard for starters should buy product best gaming keyboard for low price and many features are given go for it

Smartdevices,5,CG,  A good pocket friendly keyboard    sounds  well  Lits well    keys are simple   just as a normal keyboard   non mechanical    good purchase   liked it alot 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The product was not at all good and was poor in access now I faced a key failure and more  There is no extra key or button for replacement 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I have been using this for many months and found it very good  Amazing Quality  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Camera is that much goodCharging takes time Even though its C Typ
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The looks are so mesmerizing  it is too good Picture quality is very good  Most beautiful in this mobile is that it has all the features one needs the most and plus it is highly affordable Great work done by redmi  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Yes
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I am not happy 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Redmi Note   pro is available for the same cost which I paid   Note   is available for        but i ended up paying   thousands more  I do not have phone box else I would have opted for replacemen 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best phone with good featutes under   k
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Amazing product    Gifted this to my brother and he loved this Phone    Thanks Amazon
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Light weight   Comes with case   No earphonea 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The dept effect is not so satisfying  slow motion video quality is poor overall it is an awesome phone 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The only thing I do not like Xiaomi is its UI  Not a fan of it But other than that it is awesome It is sleek and the camera is good enough  The fingerprint sensor is really quick and efficient  though you will need to pick up the phone every time you want to open it using the fingerprint My mom uses it  and she does not want to add face recognition for unlocking so I cannot comment upon it have not tried any heavy apps in it  but with the lots of simple apps  it does not seem to be lagging Apart from the UI  everything is awesome about it  even the infrared emitter 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Its amazing I would suggest all of you to buy this phone camera is just amazing and the battery does not drain out fastIt is the best phone I have ever had
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Have issue with video recordingI ve to wait for at least    to    seconds to start recording something is wrong technically with the phone
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Well it is been just two days since I am using this phone  Few amazing thing I really liked   Camera super quality  battery life best  gaming  pubg  amazing  Phone has everything at this cost effective price  I had iphones and samsung note and S series big phones but this one    k price is awesome 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The product is dirty cheap and very feature rich   so very good value for money  However it is loaded with bloatwares   maybe it is cheap for a reason  If you are not as bothered about privacy as much as I am and love bloatwares  subjective to each individual s perception  you must definitely buy this  Else she will out more money and buy stock Android  I think MI A  has same features but is  K more expensive  or heavens willing Apple  I am too poor and or unwilling to splurge so much on just a Smartphone   but perhaps Privacy is worth the price  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  outstanding   in best mobile
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I like this phone so much
Smartdevices,1,CG,  After using   monthFrom day one battery drain like anythingPerformance of camera is below averagePerformance of application is not up to the level Storage and time taking to open a app is worst In totality it is worst phone Just by every two month mi just revamp new model and on the name of FLASH sales they just looting the customer Hence I purchase Samsung m  s and that mi note   pro given to my maid 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I am not happy with the camera specifications
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Worst mobile  needs lots of improvement   Coz am facing lots of issues in it   hearing sudden weird noices while playing YouTube or other vdos   automatically date n tym getting changed   and also brightness was not that good   and also poor camera quality 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome phone at cheap price      features are up to the mark    camera quality is superb     i got the features of expensive phone in this cheap amount      i am happy
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Somehow my phones has speaker issue can not  voice is not clear directly   I use ear phones for the most part Also cannot hear voice the videos played on web   However sound is normal in WhatsApp  wynk etc
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Phone is good  do not expect great camera experience  slim and has good battery life I would anyway not recommend this as its Chinese and there is absolutely no data security  the default apps installed will ask for unnecessary and more user information 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The redmi note   is a great mobile for daily use  I am shocked by its battery power it lasts longer  But it is screen is fragile we should select a good scree n gqurd for it as early as possible  It got one scratch when placed in my pant pocket  it is processor is fast  it is dark theme is so good for saving battery 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I LOVED THE CLARITY OF PICTURES I CLICK  due to snapdragon     it works pretty well even after using it for   months  Loved the look  Overall it really fits well for a price like this to get all the useful and lovely features 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Super
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Simejection pin is missing in box    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good phone in recent times

Smartdevices,1,CG,  Poor
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Amazon and the phone manufacturers are swindling an old couple by demanding that the phone cannot be returned or replaced till they are able to check what the defect is  It is an absolute shame that a company like Amazon has no ability to handle a situation involving    year olds who were gifted a phone and they know in one look that it is a shoddy  bad phone  Shame on Amazon  also for its blocking tactics on technical support 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  I love Redmi Mobiles  This particular purchase has a display light brightness that is unstable  I have to keep on adjusting it  It keeps getting dark on its own even if I do not touch it  Disappointed

Smartdevices,4,OR,  Ok
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Being a loyal customer having three Red Mi Note s I sincerely attempted   weeks to buy and could not get it  This insult seriously made me to think and come out of my ardent fan ship of Redmi and scout out for various other models  Based on my Survey  I found the ONEPLUS  T to be a great model for its technical specification  I bought ONEPLUS  T now ONLY DUE TO THIS WORST MARKETING STRATEGY OF XIOAMI ON REDMI NOTE PRO    I CHOSE TO MIGRATE TO ANOTHER MODEL THANKS XIAOMI
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Top pic qualityVery sensitive fingerprint readerThumbs up good value for money
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Wastage of money
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Poor performance this moble  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Received without sim ejector pin Voice not clear  Breakups while speaking 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is going to be a long review  scroll to the end for summery  I have already been using Mi band   for over a year so I will compare with it wherever required   SCREEN  Screen is just gorgeous  it is full touch AMOLED    inch  which is almost     bigger than my Mi band   s     inch  you will instantly appreciate the extra real estate  Everything is crisp and bright  there is is anti fingerprint coating  which works  but sadly no gorilla glass  And it is very hard to find and put screen guard due to it is curved glass  My MB  has many scratches after a year of use and I expect the same in MB   Display is clearly visible under direct sunlight   STRAP and COMFORT  Strap is rubbery plastic  same as Mi Band   but size is different  so MB  strap will not fit here  It does not produce much sweat and overall  it is light and comfortable  you will forget it is on your wrist after a while  Band is also non intrusive while sleeping  I have also wore My band in drizzle  while washing hands and in full blown rain  it is totally waterproof   BATTERY  Battery has always been a big plus on Mi Band series  I used to get around       days battery on Mi Band   with continuous heart rate monitor enables and     days without it  In Mi band    my battery is     after   days of use  so seems like battery life is almost same as before  BUT the charging mechanism has changed  I think it is one of the most significant upgrade since Mi Band    It was very inefficient and cluttery but now it is simply a breeze  You do not have to remove the tracker now so strap life may also improve  who knows EXTRA FEATURES  Mi band   and Mi band   both has lift to wake  timer  stopwatch  weather up to   days  vibration alarm  ideal sitting alert  music and volume change  find my phone feature  You can silent the phone from band  Receive notifications from phone  dismiss notifications  Reject and silent calls and change the brightness of the band from band itself  All the features are very refinedand works without any problem or bug whatever  Mi band   also has remote shutter control to capture images from phone HEALTH TRACKING and FEATURES  Now the most important part  All other features are useless if the band can not track properly  Mi band   had   big flaws in sleep tracking   it could not track REM sleep and could not track mid day naps  Fortunately  both the features are included in Mi band    It is a significant change and my favourite upgrade after the charger  Other sleep tracking features are as accurate as ever  Xiaomi claims that they have improved the heart rate sensor but I am getting almost same reading on both Mi Band   and    with      point difference   Mi band   now has some new indoor sports mode which gym lovers will love  It has indoor cycling  rowing machine and Elliptical  although the data you get in this is very limited  It also has Yoga mode now  which is not very accurate   Step counter is ok ish  with        accuracy roughly  but the running mode is wonderful with connected GPS  your phone s  it provides so much data like pace  stride rate  average heart rate  real time heart rate  map  average speed  personal best and so on  you will love running after wearing Mi band  Mi band   includes new stress meter  which is fun to use  just take its data with a pinch of salt   and PAI  personal activity index  about which I will update the review after some use  Tracking feature of Mi band   are best for any fitness tracker under Rs   k I am going to  Moreover  all the features are very refined and well designed  you will not encounter any bug or hiccups while using them  they just work as expected    CONS  Now some flaws  Design is very outdated  Although it is comfortable but It looks very small if you have big hands   The stripping mechanism is also not very good  I was expecting that Xiaomi will improve it at least a bit in this upgrade but seems like I will have to wait another year   The weather feature does not work most of the time  It says  connect the band to show weather   even though I am connected  Same problem was there in MB    Seems like Xiaomi ignored it   Xiaomi should introduce some metallic straps  There are  rd party straps available but their quality is just bad   Ads in android app  Ruins the whole experience   No SpO  meter  Although not as useful  but still good to have   No scratch resistent glass  or at least provide good first party curved tempered glass CONCLUSION  Mi Band   is not as significant an upgrade as MB   to    But the magnetic charger  improved sleep tracking and indoor sports mode are all excellent upgrade  Not to mention the extra screen estate  As for the first time buyers  Mi band is the most accurate band you will get under Rs   k  No other band or watch in this range have such polished UI  reliable tracking and fine hardware quality Edit  I will update add some photos of band and screenshots of tracking data soon 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Been Using Amazfit Bip since a Year which has limited Activity tracking Transreflective screen is Okay battery wise but does not look good always Then I Thought of Upgrading by Paying more bucks but surprisingly Mi band   was everywhere  on the News after its launch in China waited till October  st after it made its way finally to India What I liked  Amoled Display With more nits than Band    PAI  Stress Monitor      s of Watch faces from  rd Party apps developers   Can take it to shower swim  Magnetic Charging Cable  Enhanced REM sleep tracking this band Can Track your afternoon Naps too   Music Control  play pause Next previous Volume Up and down   Pricing for this One is so Apt Cons  Should have Given Spo  sensor not a deal breaker for me as I Own a pulse oximetre and people really do not care about Sp   after this pandemic is Over   Battery Capacity should have been Increased Instead of decreasing by   mah Mi band    Need to have a tempered Glass over Without which it could seriously take some damage scratches   Step Count is Slightly Inaccurate shows more steps than the Actual in Treadmill workout mode it shows less distance than the Actual distance covered Mi need to fix this as soon as possible through OTA updateVerdict Its a MUST HAVE perfect Little One for a fitness enthusiast  Nothing Tastes as Good As Being FIT feels Mi fit App is Really Good UI is smooth Syncs and gets data from the Band Real Fast Stats are nicely shown 
Smartdevices,4,OR,    Step count is above     accurate   it even shows    steps while i wake up in the morning   may be steps of my dreams   Sleep monitoring is also good and it records naps too   Currently the mi fit app does not that much watch faces   Light weight and the battery backup it wonderful till now Over the cover they wrote maximum input is    mA but the regular charger output is   A and i do not know if its harmful fot the device  However the magnetic charge is a nice update from previous version of the band My previous device was honorband   so Spo  is missing on this device  And the design of Honorband is much better than Mi band  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   it is not a accurate and it can show heart rate with out wearing  some time bluetooth disconnect  Sleeping mode is not correct  and step counting is calculated while I drive bike Spending      for this is bad   Above picture is taken the data with out wearing band    
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have been using mi band       and this one obviously  I am not very pleased to report that this one is being the most inaccurate in terms of step counting and also in sleep tracking The heart rate monitoring and sleep monitoring has been turned on for both in my ios mi fit app but then also every stat is way way of the track Calorie Counting Worse  Sleep tracking Is okay  Step counting Worse I updated the firmware also I ordered a replacement unit to see if the issue was with my unit or so  but it looks like there is the same issue with this unit too Xiaomi says     more accurate heart reading  as per my in dept usage it is not true  it is even more inaccurate when compared to band   May be they solves the issue by an OTA firmware  But for now it does not make sense to invest      in a crappy product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Sharing my first impression  It lacks SpO  sensor at this stage   It was introduced in the global version but not present in this    Worth the upgrade from mi band    But not from band    It offers more accurate measurement and slightly larger display  But not a big deal   It offers a premium feel with it is strap and band design itself  But the pricing could have been lower   In all of these bands  even though it has a small battery it is charging time is pretty long  around  hrs    I cannot say anything about the battery life  Since I have barely used    Anyway when we enable the   hrs heart rate and stress level monitoring it gives a warning that it may consume higher battery  So I think the battery life they have shown is not that we get    It says it detects activity and show us to turn on that mode  that is a pretty good feature  But I have tried that and I did not get the result  Hope it will be solved in the future updates 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Pros   this is the best at this price segment with great features  camera feature inbuilt  new big screen makes a difference  wallpapers are customisable  auto workout detectionCons   it still scratches really easily  the screen should have been glassThats all I just got it   days back will make an update in a month I really have no complaints except that the screen scratches sooo easily infact today I just touched a wall and it made   scratches and that is really annoying other than that this band is value for money just be careful when you use it
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Was using the Mi Band    Now ordered band    First thing that you will not miss upon unboxing is that massive difference in the strap between band   and band     Band   felt solid and was made to last  It has lasted me more than     years before a need for change  But band   strap looks so flimsy     I doubt if it will last even   months if I remove and wear the band on a daily basis  Quite disappointed with the strap quality  Looks like they will force us to keep changing the strap every quarter  Not good Will give band review after using it for a month 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  NOTE  If you are looking for Best Accurate Fitness Band under  K price   SpO   Oximeter  feature is your priority  then directly go and buy Honor Band    do not even bother reading this review any further Now for those not having above mentioned priorities or looking to upgrade their older Mi bands  I am already using this Band since Last   month  so this review is Based on over   Month of heavy usage  Being satisfied with its performance  I decided to buy one more from amazon  there is NO SpO  or Voice Assistant feature in this band  so note that  Straps of MI band   will not fit this Band  Has Lower battery backup compared to Mi band     check the review for Detailed Battery backup   This band can now track Day time sleep  but that is limited between   pm to  pm This is very long review divided into   parts namely  Quick Overview  Full Detailed review and Comparison of it with Mi Band    So if you are really looking to invest      rupees or looking to upgrade over previous gen Mi Bands  then I highly advice to read it completely  to ease your decision  If you want to get quick overview of the device  then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review  The Screen is Full Touch Coloured AMOLED with    D slightly curved at the edges   Brightness is Adjustable   It is prone to shatter if falls on face  Has LOWER Battery backup compared to Mi Band    but more than Honor Band    Its very Light weight and compact  The Strap is extremely comfortable and also replaceable   This time MI have improved the strap design by giving deeper grooves  which will avoid accidental fallouts  Has Full Whatsapp  Instagram  Message  Call  etc Notification alerts  Has NO SpO  or Voice assistant feature yet  while writing this review  Updates are not very Frequent  Connects to both android and iOS  without any problem  Has Customizable watch faces via default app and  rd party installation is also possible  Watch interface is Clean and easy to use   has more customization options   But there is NO sleep tracker TAB on the band  For that you have to use App  Has averagely accurate built in Continuous Heart Rate monitoring and Sleep Tracker and Highly accurate Pedometer  It is swimming safe as well  but touch panel is useless once water touches the screen   You will have to dry wipe the screen for proper touch functioning Charging dock is magnetic  so you need not remove the capsule like previous Mi band versions  Finally  I think Price does not justify the features  Full Detailed Review  DESIGN                   It have slim profile and bigger         D display surrounded by black bezels perfectly blends in  It is extremely Light as well  It has Circular Touch sensitive Touch button  which is almost invisible   But its NOT Home button  It is just back button  which is not very handy  It has   pin contact charging dock facing down  but now the capsule does not needs to be taken out  as charging dock is magnetically attached   Finally Quality of the strap is same as previous versions and feels comfortable  DISPLAY                    It sports      AMOLED Colour display which gives crystal clear output  The display module is Rectangular with Vibrant colours and Bright Light  Adjustable upto   Levels   Its very responsive and has good readability even in direct sunlight as well  FEATURES                     It has    Main modes namely Daily activity tracker  Heart Rate sensor  Workout  Weather  Notifications  PAI  Stress  Breathing  Events and More  settings  In Activity tracker  complete pedometer and calories details of the day are mentioned   Its     accurate according to my usage  In Heart rate sensor  you can quickly check the heart rate and it displays it in continuous manner for few seconds before it stops   Its very SLOW heart rate tracker and NOT very accurate as well   You can even set heart rate tracking on Continuous mode from the app  This band has Sleep tracking feature  but NO sleep tracker data TAB on band itself   To check the data you need to use the app   It  finally has the day time sleep data  but it works only between   pm to  pm   Its decently accurate sleep tracker  but not as accurate as honor band series  In Workout mode  there are many in built modes like walking  running  swimming  free exercise  Cycling and Yoga  etc  there is NO GPS in the band  but you can track your session with GPS if connected with phone while that session   Note that  you do not need to carry you phone while workout session  if you do not need GPS data   there is continuous heart rate tracking in any workout mode  In weather tab  you get to see the current day weather of your location   there is also full week s forecast in it  In Notification option  you can check all your smartphone notifications when connected to it   It supports phone message  whatsapp messages  etc  And you can read the complete message   It also supports call notifications  which has call Rejection and Silent option as well   You also get direct notification and sedentary alerts on band without needing to check the message option  In EVENTS  all the saved reminders in the mi fit app shall get the vibrating alert once those events tick in  This indeed is very practical and handy feature  PAI  STRESS   BREATHING I personally think are forced fitted and majority of the users will not even bother to open them up  I did not in last   months  so I will not waste time explaining them  Suffices to it that they go by names  except PAI has some women centric features  which again were not really useful  In MORE  there are various micro settings and more features like camera shutter  world clock  Timer  stop watch  Watch faces  Reboot  etc   Its very thoughtful to put extra settings or feature in the more option  so as to keep the interface clean  Watch Faces                        There are out of the box   watch faces on the band  Using the MI Fit app you can choose from more than    watch faces  It also supports  rd party watch face installation  which is a charm  Now there is support for even Live watch faces  BATTERY PERFORMANCE                                       It charges quite quickly from   to      within an hour  With band not connected to bluetooth  not in continuous HR mode lasts more than    Days   OFFLINE MODE   With Bluetooth connected and Continuous HR mode  it lasts upto       Days  If Fitness app is used for about a hour or more with sleep assistant ON  then it lasts upto    Days max All these data are lower compared to Mi band   which has    days     days      days backup respectively for each scenario  CONS               there is NO SpO  feature  which Honor is giving since      and considering its importance in current situation  Unnecessary loading of modes like Stress and Breathing  which are not practical in todays world  I mean why would you need an band to sit for a minute and breath   And speaking of stress calculator  I never got close to decent reading from it in   months  NO Smart tracking mode in Heart Rate Tracking yet  Here again Honor has this since       Takes least a minute to connect to phone each time   need bluetooth as well as Location ON  least for me and FYI I am using it with Redmi K    which belong to same company s umbrella  can not view Detailed Sleep tracking on the band itself  You will need the companion app for that  To Turn the band ON every time  you need to connect charging dock to it  COMPARISON with Mi Band                                                Design section  Both being very similar in appearance  MI band   has advantage of magnetic dock Winner   Mi Band      Display section  Though Mi   has bigger display  the on paper Brightness of Mi   is higher Touch response is same on both Winner   MI Band       Pedometer   Workouts  Pedometer accuracy is almost same on both the bands But Mi   has slightly increased number of workout  even though they are not      accurate Winner   Mi Band      HR Sensor  Its same  nothing else to mention Winner   Draw    Sleep Tracker  Accuracy of both the band is similar and below     But Mi   now has Day time tracking Winner   Mi Band      Battery Backup  This was shocker for me  Mi   has almost     bigger battery being older version and gives almost     more backup Winner   MI Band     Accessories  Being in the market for a year  Mi   has advantage Winner   MI Band     Features  Though Mi   has more number of features compared to Mi    most of them are useless Winner   Draw    Price  Mi   being currently     rupees cheaper  is clear winner Winner   MI band  SCORE   Mi Band      points   Mi Band      points VERDICT                   Now  to sum up I mentioned   points  out of which Mi Band   wining by just a single point is not a great thing  Yes  there are some genuine upgrades like Magnetic dock  more customizable interface  dynamic watch faces  but these are good enough for upgrading if you already own Mi band   I would say if and only if you have Mi band   or lower version or no fitness bands at all  then go for this band as your first fitness band  Again  if you are looking for more accurate fitness band under  k with SpO  feature  then Honor Band   should be your pick Hope this helps you make sound decision 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have always been skeptical about fitness bands n I still am as I think fitness bands are not that important but the pricing of this fitness band makes it a quite lucrative choice What I have liked so far    Fairly accurate step counting  I did counting in my mind while walking n then checked on band n the steps the band counted was most of the times accurate which is very impressive considering its price    A lot of workout modes    Menstrual cycle calculator  hence this band can be a very god choice for women as well    Battery life appears to be quite good too but will update after exhausting the current battery life What I hve not liked    The app sometimes does not sync especially the heart rate which it only syncs when it is calculated manually    The home page of the app is not customizable    Band sometimes does not count steps  Although it again starts working if you move the band a little while you are wearing it    PAI is useful but at the cost of battery Update   with a mild usage  one can easily get a battery life of more than    days And even with a moderate usage  a       days battery is on the table Sleep tracking appears to be good too  It is not accurate but quite close and can help people to understand their sleep structure No risk of water damage yet  I have taken a shower while wearing the band and it still works perfectly 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Honestly here are some pros   consPros      good looking as compare to other bands    accurate readings   display is    easy to use CONS   battry life don you even think of    days of battry life  if you want it to run for    days you have to use it ok only basic settings and if you want to use as smart band then max battry life is arround     days 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Step Cound  heart rate are working super fine   PAI is an extra advantage  However  I have doubt if it is monitoring sleep properly or not  it is not detecting day time nap or sleep  Hope its a bug and will be solved in coming updates 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  pathetic band  damn inaccurate and you can not even return the item poor packaging poor item  think before buying from amazon   wasted my money
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Thanks amazon for the quick delivery Product is amazing as you might have seen in many reviews  Band strap feels very comfortable on hand As I have received it today itself  so can not provide more details regarding accuracy and all Missing spo  feature  which is available in honor band   
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I do not know why my band is not switch onStill charging but screen is showing only battery barI m gona returne this and ask for new bandThis is my  rd redmi band but in this time very disappointed
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Just a creepy product guys  Within   days of purchase  the screen glass started getting mild scratches  Within   week it went to severe scratches  In   weeks duration the glass got cracked  My hard earned money of      bucks got crushed just like that in a tiny span of    days  Now writing tons of chats to mi team for replacement of screen or watch which comes under   year warranty  Amazon washed their hands saying the return window had got closed  Contact the mi  More than money its killing my time a lot  I will definitely throw this creepy product to dust bin if I get any nuisance reply from mi saying screen is not covered under warranty  BEWARE AND STAY AWAY Guys 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Purchased it on  st October       Got delivered very next day In the box you get a magnetic charging extension and the band with few reading materials Everyone knows the pros but I would like to clarify the main con here Mi band did not try to improve from past   generations  The step tracking is pretty inaccurate  I traveled through my bike and it calculated      steps  I thought Mi would do something of the step counter  However it is pretty inaccurate Rest all is very good So if your sole purpose is step counting then you will be disappointed 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  So this is my first impression review  I had ordered this MI band   in the first sale on  st of October and it was delivered the second day itself but when I opened the package it was a bit damaged so I had to to ask for a replacement the reason was there was slight scratches on the MI band     Update  The replacement was immediately send to me on  th of October later I was excited to open this package so I opened it NIC it was nicely bubble wrap so the package should not get damage that was really prompt from Amazon delivery side  About the product  This is is an amazing and the cheapest available fitness band in the market which gives a lot of features likeDecrease and bright LED display a and a really good battery life of two weeks also so this charges quickNow xiaomi has added some good features in this band like ok a bigger      inch OLED Touch screen and a bigger battery and upgraded industry leading PPG heart rate sensor and the silicon band also feels premium the best what I like is the magnetic charger which is a really good upgrade on this iteration of MI BandThis MI band   is really a great product for the price and I am loving itThat s all folks

Smartdevices,4,OR,  Review of the MiBand   coming from the MiBand   First Impressions Likes The increase in screen size The display is crisp and bright for the size of the band Alot of functions which were only accessible via the app in the MiBand   is now found on the band itself Charging method is definitely a big upgradeWatch faces and scrolling through the band is smooth and responsiveThe amount of features for the priceDislikes The packaging was not at all presentable  The MiBand   came with a better unboxing experience Wish we could buy the band in the preferred color than buying the strap separately Will update soon with battery life and other points that I come across  After    Days of Usage   Battery  Lasted    days from a full charge   Not always connected to the phone Watch faces  Many more can be found via apps in the PlayStore  Android Useful features  Timer  Alarms  Reminders  Music controlStep count sometimes gives me       before waking up from bed Scrolling through the interface is smooth and responsive 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  EDIT after   days of use  Step count seems super inaccurate  Counts many many more steps than actual and also wore mi band   and   on the other hand to compare  The mi   counts more steps than both   and   Biggest disappointment  The display scrathes SO easily  it is just been   days of normal use and it has scratches  Still have to compare the cycling mode on the band with Strava to see how accurate the former is  Have low hopes since step count is already messed upLooks like I am the first person to review the band  Was eagerly waiting for it and it got delivered within    hours  Amazing speed of delivery  Love the band  Display is great  the new features are pretty cool  Big upgrade from Mi Band    which is what I was using 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  A very major upgrade for me since I was using the MI Band   before this  Been using since   days with only sleep assistant on and use it to track my evening runs too  In   days the battery has come down to     with moderate to heavy usage  Which is quite impressive  The biggest upgrade for me was the music and camera controls  Love that feature  can not be really sure about the pedometer but if you ask me personally then I think it is under counting the steps  The heart rate monitor is more accurate than the band   so plus points for that  Countless watchfaces are a plus point too  I have not yet tried the PAI mode as yet  The sleep tracker is also quite accurate and it tracks your REM sleep too  Also a bonus is the nap tracker  Overall I think the accuracy is between    to      An added spO  meter would have been better are Honor band   which released last year already has it  Overall value for money  Go for it 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Mi band   does not support anything written in HINDI  eg contacts  messages etc      inaccurate STEP counter   Event when I have walked barely     steps  it shows           steps   RIDICULOUS Always keeps measuring bp even if you put it on a table it keeps measuring Blood Pressure You can not CALL or message with mi band   Build quality is cheap plastic rubber 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Really loved the new version in terms of    Screen quality is very rich and bright   Health related features are accurate   Customisable and very user friendly firmwareDislike  Package   Mi Band   box design gives very cheap look  Would really love if they would have maintained the overseas design  since that gives the premium look and feels better when gifted to someone  that is where it lost   star 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent and Very good upgrade from Mi band    Integrated with PAI and Able to track naps   Magnetic charging dock  large display better quality display compared with mi band    New work out modes   Stress count and lot more  Full package health tracker  But Strap bit thinner compared to mi band   but Strap look has changed 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This is my first product on band using Thanks to Amazon for fast and good deliveryAbout product  Postive   Design is good    Options are user friendly   Negative   Expectation is not met  only     ok with the product futures    Walking Skipping are not accurate    Battery connect volt is not matching with regular chargeable currently in use    MI fit app does not user friendly  options are not well designed  It having lot of bugs and bugs  So not able to track in that app Over all I am not satisfied with the band function and futures 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It does not suite for boys whith hairs in hands  The sensors could not scan your body due to hairs  Spend little more and buy a better one  Please do not waste money on the this product 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I am using realme   pro device and I can not pair camera   Very disappointing  I am returning the product and never buying anything from mi again  Goodbye mi 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  My third MI Band    Previously had used MI band    MI band   and now MI band       I always go with MI band over many other brand bands available in market  Light weightAlmost accurate data  data accuracy has increased a lot from MI band   which i have used Nice charging system now   Finally we do not need to bring out the tablet part to charge   Display awsome as usal with amoled display brighter under sun as well   Touch screen as usal best no complain on thatFeatures increased from MI band  Missing SpO  measure although keeping to the price point we can not expect that   Fast pairing with MI Fit app   Overall indeed the best fitness band under     
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Mi Band   is absolutely worth the price tag  it is once again the best cheap fitness tracker you can buy  hands down Pros      sports mode  Dynamic watch face  Magnetic suction charging     inch large display screenCons  Lacks SpO  monitoring
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Disply was nice   extra features are good   In my previous review i said many software issues  but now i solved   its all depend on phone settings  Now i receive whether updates and all notifications   the only issue is  If i switch on raise the wrist to show disply option it is too sensitive  when i ride bike small shakes will on the disply constantly  its reduve the battery   Xiomi need  to solve these problems by giving update
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Same as band   no difference except for a minor increase in the display size which by the way goes unnoticed as it is very small  I would not recommend anyone to buy this  instead go for better bands which offer better features like SPO   ECG etc  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Totally Insane  It has just reached today and has totally Impressed me  A very good upgrade from Mi band   I found the touch quality very responsive and it was very soft The on hand feel was very premium It was delivered to me with    of battery   it took almost      mins to charge completely with the insane magnetic charger  Pretty awesome The brightness is very good and very clear display can not tell much about battery life as I have used it only about     hrs and what I found is there was only    battery drain after a pretty heavy usage as I was continuously trying the features     sports modes  Pai  Heart rate monitor  loved all these in he first impression Music control feature  From all internal and external corners  I found this small lovely band very nice 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   My band   s display stopped working within   th days of purchasing it  Xiomi service center refused to  replace  return or refund because the display has a minor scratch which is there with normal wear and tear and it is impossible to see unless put under a light source I saw the screen glitching since day   and thought it was a software issue  and I waited for the update  But Since the update it glitched like this and now the screen is dead  I visited service center at greater Noida as soon as I could but their response was sub par and they did not replace it because there was a minor scratch on top glass of the display   which one could hardly see even by glaring intensely  I could not even return it on Amazon since it only covered for    days return policy  Blame my bad luck I would advise everyone against purchasing this band  Wait till the issue of display is resolved with a midlife update  Or you could  just waste     k odd rupees on this faulty product by XIOMI 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am giving review after using it for three days  The product is very good at battery backup  The heart rate monitoring is also very good  The PAI is an extra advantage  The step count is also accurate except few cons i e while pushing or pulling something or moving some object by push or pull it is counting some steps which I noticed on the first day of use  Another one is I used it for sleep quality measurement but when I woke up I noticed some    step count which I do not how 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The device was thinner than I expected it to be  I was using the boat Progear before this one  and this is like a breath of fresh air after that last band  The screen is more than adequately bright  with deep blacks that AMOLED offers  The watch faces are a bit on the lower side  but we can customize them and even add our own wallpapers  so that makes up for it I was a little bummed about the fitness tracking modes  badminton is an essential to me   but freestyle is a jack of all trades mode  and that solves my issue The other new features Xiaomi has added  such as pai  and better sleep tracking  also tracks naps  are a welcome The accuracy I felt was a bit off when I manually checked it by walking and then counting steps  but I will have to extensively test to verify if it is within the margin of error  Right now it seems fine Overall  it is a great value for money product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Upgraded from Mi Band   to Mi Band   This band is very good    Lots of watch faces   Superb Touch Screen and good response   Heartrate is accurate   Stress feature is good to have Only   problem it have   If you enable Whatsapp notification  it will show message if you received only one  for multiple messages you have to reach you phone to see    Sometimes it take steps count even if you are in Car or Bike Otherwise very good purchase and fast delivery 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Tracking of steps and sleep monitoring is faulty  the accuracy of stress level monitoring is also questionable  Basically software is a big fail  Hardware on other hand got better  with better charging connector and bigger size and display  Until the software is fixed  this band is waste of money 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The updates in Mi band    are totally useless   The mifit app is the worst app for fitness tracking  so many glitches even for simple personalisation   The PAI is pathetic pathetic feature which does nothing but sucks up all the battery life   Speaking of which the battery life is no where near the said    days  with all the optimisation the battery lasts for mere   days   False false publicity   Not user friendly interface at allWon t recommend buying it at all  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  If you want to buy to track your workout it is the worst band  Just have a look I do walk   km  approx       steps daily morning  km measured by car and step count by my self  Using this band given a horrible result Day   in workout mode band used without mobile means without GPS it showed my walk     km and      stepsDay   in workout mode with mobile showed exact   km but      stepsDay   normal mode showed     km and      steps  Can you believe   different type of result in same type walk       step instead of      steps is horrible So if you want a notification band with heart rate and stress monitor its good but not for work out  For workour you should buy a GPS watch 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Sleep tracking makes wrong estimates   it says I slept for   hrs last night  though I slept from      PM till      AM  SpO  measurement function is NOT available  ALEXA is also not available 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Accuracy is not that good especially stress score  Not sure how it calculates your stress which is ideally based on so many things  many a times I was totally stressed out but it shows relaxed  Heart rate and sleep score accuracy is also mediocre  Fine for its price and features but it is not what it claims exactly 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Just loving it so far till now  Been a day s thorough usage Took exactly   mins to charge  Make sure that you use a  V rating charging adapter  The current rating does not matter here  But the adapter should be able to provide a minimum of    mA which I am sure every adapter does Been      hours of constant monitoring  keeping it connected over Bluetooth to my phone and lots of checking up of things and features  Battery has gone down to      which is pretty good I must say Step counting  sleep monitoring everything is just working flawlessly for me  As I saw some people had reported inaccurate data monitoring  which I could not find happening here  not at all infact  it is accurate  Just making sure the band fits perfect  I somehow felt that maybe an improper wearing style could be a major contributor to getting wrong readings or no readings at all The other functions like find my phone    is very handy when in case we forget where did we keep our phone  Weather  app notification  call notification  timer  stopwatch  camera control  music control   just loving it all   There are just two things I could not yet figure out are   screen lock    enabling that option does not do anything  And other one is activitiy detection      I am yet to see how it sends a notification for this But overall    seeing the features and accuracy   also how the app provides detailed info   I find it to be a perfect buy  Worth it  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Likes   Improved built quality   Amoled display    Heart rate tracking   sleep  step counts are accurate   PAI  Stress monitor  Breath exercise mode are really usefull add on feature   Notification are crystal clear  can be read easily incoming  messages without picking phone   Super Fast ConnectivityDislike   Slightly overpriced if it would comes for       is better price and can aford everyone   Simler to Band     except addon features and amoled display    Band battery have been draning quickly  if we use all features   For example PAI  rise to wake option Continues Heart rate   ERM moniteringIn nut she will satisfied with Band   impressive performance in the smart band segment  Thanks Amazon for express Delivery in the amid of pandemic situation
Smartdevices,1,OR,  do not count steps properly
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The WORST product ever bought from Amazon  Problem in data sync and stress measuring  Weather syncing is problematic too  Pathetic experience 
Smartdevices,3,OR,     It has nice display  its much brighter if you make it full you will feel irritation in eyes  its that much bright    battery is good will last around      days as per usage  its not bad because we daily charge our phones so will not be issue to charge this one in   days    Software Mi fit is ok good but many times it goes in connecting mode   but its much more optimise    Lot of mi band watch faces  biggest plus point  you will get few third party apps and they hv much more variety of watch faces so big plus for this    in step count i feel its hit or miss  its about     accurate   sleep monitoring is good  but its risky to sleep wearing band as it cud damage your band    i feel locking mechanism is worst  while driving it got off twice in just   days  in and while sleep it gets off once  so it makes me awake    quality over all is great  build is super fine    lift to wake is also hit or miss many times about         which is bit annoying     Spo  is missing which is very important in current situation  Even Honor band with same price category has it Over all its nice band  with few compromises 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Steps count is so worst that I calculated it manually   I walked    steps but it shows somewhere around      steps   and this happens everytime   I have calculated With Samsung watch and it gives around      steps count for complete day but this band gives       steps for     hours for my daily in house routine 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Good   bt i did not get any warranty cardI hv seen in description i will get   year warranty   where is my bands warranty card   
Smartdevices,3,OR,  They delivered Me used Product Then they Replaced it  Mumbai wear house is sending used product  New product is dispatched from banglore  This happened to me Twice  unnecessary Waste of Time for the buyer  Coming to the Mi band it is just OK I bought it for cycling purpose to measure my heart rate    it is not really accurate  No built in gps so you have to carry ur phone to measure route  the Mi fit app is not showing altitude gained information  but other apps on mobile r showing altitude like  decathlon coach  this band has good display  hope it dose not get dim as it happened with my mi band    do not rely on this product for fitness  I just brought it for motivation   not showing time while on cycling mode charging is super easy
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Mi band jus launched there new  TH generation of the smart band with some slight changes and new features The smart bands built quality is awe inspiring as they have a full aluminum alloy body  and the band is made up of thermoplastic elastic  which does not feel like cheap rubber bands The design of the band is similar to MI band four  There not any significant changes in the design front At the price of     Rs  they offer a     inch AMOLED display and talking display it has right viewing angles  and the brightness of the display is good  you can easily watch the time in direct sunlight  Further  it has Bluetooth      water resistance of up to    meters  and no inbuilt GPS The watch has a heart rate sensor and motion sensor  and in our test heart rate sensor has done an impressive job  and we also compared its sensor with apple watch series five  and the results were almost identical  The motion sensor also worked fine and has given prompt results The watch offers N numbers of features like music control  camera control  sleep tracking  idle alert   alarm clock  reminders  and different workout modes In the end  the main question is if you have MI band four so you should upgrade to it or not  And the answer to the question is not necessarily as there are very slight changes like inch     display wherein MI band   had a      inch display  upgraded heart rate sensors  and slightly tweaked band UI 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  If you had used Firtbit and it is app you may not like this band  This app is very clumsy  You need to search for basic things There is no proper documentation as well  I do not understand why it is not tracking floors climbed automatically  The one thing that I miss a lot is hourly activity tracking  If you have not walked     steps in an hour  Fitbit would remind you  No such option in mi band  I know it is     price of my Charge   HR 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Same problem like recent one  not updating weather after syncing  wrong heart rate monitoring  step count is wrong  disconnecting in cycling mode even phone is in my pocket  I replaced once to see if the problem is with band  but new band show his true colours  the band is not on my wrist still it is showing me heart rate  I am on my bed  it is showing step count  it is not counting day sleep  In short this band is   
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I have been using this band for past week and here are the pros   cons of this bandPros Value for money More activity tracking options PAI   Personal Action Intelligenc  is another advantage It can help women with menstrual period tracking Charging is easy with magnet chargingCons It does not track sleep in the day time SpO  feature should have been useful which is not in  the band  NFC payment option only work in china with ali pay It acts in abnormal way in shower or while swimming   it  starts scrolling on its own   Just a average band if compared to technology  available in the market
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I ordered this with so much expectations    and i experienced very good tracking of sleep stress hbm only for  st    days   after   th day    Stress monitering is not At all working  Battery drains so much   within  th day       hand movements also counts on step count  which is very bad  and very slow bluetooth  specially stress monitering is like fake and sometimes it shows NO DATA  NO SPO   worst MI service
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The band gets frequently disconnected from mi fit app  Does not serve the purpose  It is not returnable  I am not sure if a replacement will help Edit   The band was already fixed to the strap in pack and looking at other reviews  it appears the band and strap are usually separate in the pack  I might have received an used returned item  The return replacement window is over and I have no choice  There is no guarantee that the replacement will be a new one 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The step counter is accurate for steps unless someone is driving when the band counts steering wheel turns as steps Heart rate monitor seems accurate  Band says that my heart rate rises after I have caffeine The stress measuring system seems to measure adrenaline more than stress  When my adrenaline seems high  the band says that I am under stress  More females pay attention to me when my stress levels are high compared to when the band says that I am relaxed 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Everything is working as expected only problem is with pedometer   It is registering steps even when i am sitting or driving even when i am sleeping and  i am sure i do not sleep walk     I do not know whether it is hardware realted issue or software if it is software realted issue please provide fix Xiaomi   So if you are buying it for because yiu want to count steps then it is not for you   Sleeping tracking accurate enought like      heart beat and stress accuracy is also btween         overall accuracy is about      have not tested battery life but so for it seem like it will not give battery backup of   week as claimed by Xiaomi it ll give max   days to    days of backup  They advertise battery saver mode but I can not find it anywhere if anyone know how to keep band on battery saver mode please tell me 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This is one of the best fitness band you can buy under       I have used it for several days and compared the accuracy with my Apple watch and it is as accurate as my Apple watch Although battery life could have been better but over a good smart band  We have made a dedicated full review video on our YT channel Best Technicals  You can check that before buying and also we are giving away five Mi band    So go and check it out  Maybe you can win a one for you 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not buy this band accuracy is not correct on this band like step count and heart monitoring and I am place the band on my Bluetooth speaker and I am start to measure heart monitoring option its show result   bpm so do not waste you re money batter option is honor  band
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Initially I was confused between Mi band   and Amazfit bip you  But then I decided to go for Mi band    I got it at a price of Rs      that was like a loot deal Pros     Display is gorgeous  colours are punchy and infinity no s of watch faces are available       Believe me TFT lcd displays can never match to amoled  This was the reason I did not choose bip you    Heart rate sensor  steps tracking and sleep tracking is very accurate  Though spo  is not available but who cares  nobody will care for spo  after this pandemic and also we can not rely on a fitness band for blood oxygen saturation monitoring    Mi fit app is far better than Huawei health app or amazfit app    You can easily get   days of backup when continuous heart rate monitoring is on and that is more than enough for me  Charging is also very convenient Note  If you are buying a fitness band for sleep tracking  do not go for bip you  Because watches with large displays are very uncomfortable during sleep  Mi band   is perfect for this purpose Cons  No cons yet      And I am sure there will be no cons in the future 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Yes  this SMART watch will show you standing even you are walking on the treadmill at the speed of  Kmph  why bcz you have hold your hand still for   sec or so  is not it smart  So  whole tracking thing is based on your hand movement  if you are standing still and waving your hand like walking it will show you are walking  great If the censer area will become wet due to water or sweat  it wonk show correct reading  like it will show your heart is resting while you are running on the treadmill if your hand is wet  now you can imagine how often your hand will be wet So  after seeing all these smartness I really believe that what other things claimed by company for this device will be very true  you should experience this if spending Rs        does not bother you at all  Good Luck 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This little guy is a beast  It easily gives me more than    days of battery on a single charge and the magnetic charge is awesome  I do not have to remove it from the straps  I am writing this review after a month of usage  Now let us get on to the aesthetics and performance First it looks cool with amoled colour screen and good response to tge touch  The straps are comfortable and I think can fit everyone Then  the performance is great  This Mi band has been refined so much compared to its predecessors  Functionality has been improved a lot with better accuracy and sensitive detection  It can monitor the heart rate  no  of steps walked  calories burnt and even the stress levels and menstrual cycles for women  I would have given it five stars but but did not coz I also wanted to measure blood pressure which it can not do  And the interface with the mi fit app requires too many permission of which I am a little uncomfortable I hope this helps you 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  At the name large display and magnetic dock charging system they are taking       At the name of features customer is getting nothing 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very disappointed  Got my unit from  st sale  sensors malfunctioning and came in tortured packaging  Ordered replacement unit  came insanely tortured and with pathetic strap quality  sensors were accurate this time  Amazon India s delivery and product quality is not great as before it used to Got it returned   
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Pros  a     day battery with    min interval heart rate detection  will decrease on increasing the frequency b  comfortable while sleepingC  vibration is strong enough to wake you upD  display is bright enough and responsive tooe  changeable themesCons  a  If you lose the charging cable  then it is a game over if you live at some remote place b  After   months of using it  the wake up feature of the screen  based on gyroscope  fails to respond sometimes nowC  miscounts the steps
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I received duplicate product  It looked like same  when I tried to connect with mi fit app  it unable to connect with app  Hence  I checked the product and not found any MI logo into this band  Also  its display and back sensors are different from MI band   Totally disappointed from this delivered product  Its waste of money with depression complimentary 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I made around       steps for testing the step count and it counted around      whereas mobile device counted to      and fitbit charge   properly around      so I have to say the step count is     accurate  Heart rate sensor I am quite skeptical as even when not used it shows BPM reading this may get resolved with software updates   Display is good and watch faces stress monitoring are something for which I switched to mi band    Overall I would say it is good but accuarcy should be made better with updates
Smartdevices,4,OR,  there is no doubt that MI Bands are the best value for money fitness trackers you can get  There are many good things about the Mi Band    which you must have read quite a few times in the reviews and even in YouTube videos I will try to list the pros  Amazing battery life  With literally every battery consuming feature turned on  still can easily give me a week of usage  Gorgeous Amoled display  The colours are super punchy and brightness is sufficient enough to view even in direct sunlight  Comfortable fit  loads of software features  breathing  PAI  etc  and good variety of watch faces  The list goes on   I would suggest you to watch a review video on YouTube to get to know all the features I wanted to focus on the few drawbacks here   Even it is the best fitness tracker you can get for the price  does not mean its perfect  Nothing in this world is perfect  The design seems kind of old  Its not dull or old fashioned  but is very much same to the Mi Band    Gimmicky stress monitoring  Its not very accurate and does not use the most accurate method of measuring stress  Good its there tho Overall  a good upgrade over my previous band    Not much has changed since the last year s band    so if you already bought a band   last year  there is no real need to upgrade 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Simple step count and distance does not match that with of other application while walking  Tested and compared multiple times   Sleep data also looks non reliable   Also for Mi   band blue tooth detection is buggy and takes too long I read good positive reviews and bought this but it is not accurate and error margin are quite high to ignore it  Use it as a fancy clock nothing more 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Used mi band  Mi band  Honor band  If I give an honest review then do not go for thisUsing this from last    daysCons  sleep tracking is not accurate as honor band   and mi band    I bought this for calculating the sleeping time Step count is not accurate even if you r seating on hammock it will show you have reached today s scores  Even      steps to      steps I have seenQuality is good but it has damaged my skin I will upload my pic later may be due to always tracking heart rate featureIf I talk about battery life then all features are activated hardly can work for   days means it will fall    to     per daySpO  sensor is missing in this variantSpecially now days it is so help in corona pandemicApp   honor band app was good then this for tracking sleep dataOther features are very good for daily activitiesSo  if you really want to track something then go for thisElse you can show off gadget in front of everyone that you r updated and you have latest version with the time
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It have only good battery life    Other thing are waste    Waste of money    Wrong pedometer    showing      km in just      steps   Like     I m walking with a step distance with   meter     Waste of money i was waiting for it but fully disappointed    no spo  in it     I m returning it    No accuracy at all
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using it for two days   Display is bigger compared to previous generation and brighter you can look even in Sunlight   Counting steps accurately   Heartrate is good   Charging method is best method when compared with other bands   Sleep tracking is accurate and even calculates REM and naps calculation is also accurate   will not measures blood oxygen level
Smartdevices,5,OR,  What a band to have  It has a see through display which makes the screen transparent and a future tech at such a low price is a must  Very good display but the band itself is not much of an upgrade over mi band   as it does not have spo  sensor with ther version they are selling out of China  Also does not come with nfc  Only upgrade you will notice over band   is much better magnetic charger 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  No SPo  function and    days battery backup looks good only on paper but enabling all the features will drain the battery in just   days    less star for no SPo  and another less for less battery backup  Excluding few all the features are same as MI Band    Except this two things everything looks great 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I got next day delivery as promised by Amazon  I am using the band since   days and below is my review    Easy to use   Very good MI app with good analysis   Step counts are bey very inaccurate   Heart rate readings are very inaccurate   Band comes out when running or playing cricket  Badminton  volleyball etc   Battery life seems good as only     lost in   days 
Smartdevices,1,OR,        rating to this product after using   days  Pros can be seen others reviewHere I am writing coins   Daylight sleeping monitor not available   Step accuracy is       Feeling pain in my hand  feels like it is burning your hand   While monitoring heart rate its radiation feel like someone pinning in my hand
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Remember one thing when using the band for first time that it take a couple of days to get accuracy right  In the beginning you would notice that it is not measuring distance properly  The best solution is that you keep it connected with app for first few days Now let me give detailed review DISPLAYDisplay is excellent  If you turn the brightness to maximum level then it is visible even in sun  There are various designs for watch to choose from so that is a benefit as well However screen is not scratch proof so I would recommend using tempered HEART RATE MONITORThe accuracy of heart rate monitor depends on where you have placed band on your wrist and how tight  If it is extra tight then the band will show heart rate more than normal  If it is loose then it will give lower rate If your heart rates flactuates due to any reason like pausing exercise etc then the band will give inaccurate results I used oxy meter at doctor s clinic to check accuracy of band and unfortunately it was off by    Step CountThe band does good job of counting steps  It manages to detect when you are walking even with different walking styles  For example in winter I keep my hands in pocket but that does not affect steps counting However i have noticed that it fails to count first few steps of the day EXERCISE MODEThe band comes with few exercise modes like Walking  Running  Swimming etc I have only used walking mode  The steps are updated real time and it also keeps a tab of exercise duration  It also measures your walking speed  distance covered and heart rate  On completion of each km the band vibrates One good feature is that if you suddenly stop walking  the app detects it and pauses the exercise mode  Once you start walking again  it will resume automatically BATTERY LIFEIt heavily depends on usage  If you are wearing it   x  then band will run out of battery in    to    days 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   UPDATE  The battery lasts me for only approx    days  And this is with HR tracking and sleep tracking OFF and     workouts of   hour each in a week    Far below expectations  Also  the Bluetooth range is very limited  Keeps losing connection with the phone  Also has some bug that keeps showing previous days calendar alert from time to time esp  after reconnecting with the phone  Please DO NOT go for this one  Honor band   is much more stable and functional I have been using an Honor Band   for the past year  Now it has been handed over to the wife  I was in two minds whether to buy another honor Band or go for the Mi Band    I pair it with iPhone    Pro on latest version of iOS  My decision has been mainly based on two factors    I do NOT need the SpO  tracking   I hardly ever used it on the honor band and do not find any use for it    The mobile app of the Honor band is really bad  You cannot change watch faces via the iOS app and need an Android phone for it  Luckily I had my old android phone and found a watch face I liked and used that throughout the year Now  things I liked about the Honor Band   compared to Mi Band      Sleep tracking   the honor band has lesser battery life compared to the Mi Band   but does a great job at sleep tracking   even naps during the day time  Here  in the Mi Band    I get a warning that  Battery life will reduce severely  if I turn on Sleep tracking  And for some reason I cannot still understand  sleep tracking is clubbed with Heart Rate detection    HR detection   Honor band provides the ability to have continuous HR detection or at a frequency or  Smart   Smart conserves battery and it uses some kind of sampling algorithm to do HR detection  No such option in Mi Band   either it is continuous  Battery draining  or it is off  And in the continuous mode  you can go only till max every    minutes for a sample  once an hour would have been better for the battery    One thing I have noticed is the Bluetooth range   With my phone in the living room  if I visit the bedroom  the Honor band   used to remain connected and I used to get the notifications fine  With Mi Band    that is not the case  It gets disconnected within the same distance  Could be an aberration in my reading  but I have observed it multiple times    There is a BUG with the HR detection or the sensor   See the video I have attached  It continues to remain ON hours after the workout has been stopped  This significantly drains the battery   the workaround is to sync the band with the Mi Fit app by going to the home screen of the app and pulling downwards to refresh  The sensor stops scanning after this step  Seems to be an issue So I have kept HR detection and sleep assist to OFF  It only kicks in when I am doing a workout   I mostly use it for outdoor walk and outdoor cycling The display is better than Honor Band     at least I find it to be more readable  the colors are great and the watch faces are simple  Weather app gives weather forecast   not that I would use the band to see that  it is been   days and the battery is at      So I have no doubts that the battery of this band will far outlast the Honor Band    The strap is ok  I preferred the latch and buckle one of honor Band  it is far more secure  This one  if it brushes against something  it will come off  Security wise  this strap is not all that great 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Ordered surprise gift for wife to gift on karwachauth  band did not connected to the app  Tried numerous ways  clearing cache  reinstalling app  new phone   nothing worked  What a disappointment Ordered a replacement  hope next piece is delivered and is quality checked first 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  The product is a little tempramental  It decides by itself when it wishes to show you the incoming caller alert  It does not flash the SMS   Whatsapp   etc  The battery does not last more than a week  Good charger  interesting time display options and nice shades of the watch straps 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Mi Smart Band   ReviewRecently I bought Mi Smart Band   from Amazon and here comes it is hands on review  I got the band for Rs      and it is about Rs     more than its predecessor version Mi Band   Just like any other fitness band  it offers basic features like step counting  calorie burning  timer  alarm  weather  notifications etc However  Xiaomi has come up with a handful of new features in Mi Band   which I felt very cool Aesthetically  it has got a full touch  water resistant AMOLED display and looks nice in eyes Functionally  it is superior to Mi Band   and comes up with    workout modes such as Walking  Treadmill  Yoga  Cycling  Elliptical  Rowing  Swimming  Freestyle etc Step counter is most accurate  Another important feature is heart rate monitoring  Sleep monitoring and analysis feature is yet  another functionality  Interestingly  it can track naps as well as REM sleep There are additional features such as Stress monitoring  Guided breathing exercises and Women s health monitoring to track such as recording of menstrual and ovulation phases Statistics of all functionalities can be viewed using Mi Fit app  A variety of watch faces are also available for customizations Overall  Mi Band   is worth buying  Go for it 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Great features present but most of them do not work well or less efficient   remote control of songs are good  volume and track changese works  but will not work if one is already in a work out session   Multitasking missing If you chose work out session and you will not be able to change music track  Unless you stop the work out then go to the relevant to do it So it lacks the multitasking feature And background app running    If you chose to walk you need to switch on the GPS from mobile  Again it is waste  At least it should be optional    The notifications save only the latest one   Sleep tracking is good Reminders are great  The stress meter  Other features are not so efficient   it is just for time pass fun   Automatic workout session missing It is irritating to keep switching to various workouts by stopping saving then select the next workout Missing smart features  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Nice   simple design  Lot of features in this upgrdaded version for this price tag   brand quality  Heart  stress  sleeping patern monitoring are working fine and accuracy level    to      Sports activity monitoring  Notification alert are day to day features are good  slim fit on wrist without any irritation and can be worn   x   battery backup of max     days is decent   depends upton settings like heart rate stess  Pi Monitoring and may vary    Overall must by Smart band for quality   pricing 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Accuracy is      Sometimes it is failed to detect the motion of your workout Maybe that is the problem behind inaccuracy  O  diagnosis is absent  surprisingly   No automatic wake up the display  unfortunate   Good display  good battery life  and good quality   Please adjust     meters extra with every kilometer and     calorie burns with your showing digits   The heart rate monitor is very good 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Three things     The time shown in active workout mode is too small to read  Even with specs    The distance tracking is inaccurate  The mobile app and the watch have a    mtr difference    you have to carry the watch as there is no GPS  So it will not show you the route    there is no way one can go to the home screen while the workout mode is on  One has to stop the active mode 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Product features are certainly great as publicised  This fitness band just measures the steps  Display is pathetic  you can not read a single thing on the screen  Mobile app is so difficult to operate  You have to   different clicks to see your weekly performance   It does not not gone periodic reminders to meet your goals  There are no feature to build alerts  Overall very  disappointed  I have used fit bit in the past n this one is comparatively very very poor  Would never recommend  Please take mine  Will give it for free 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Sometimes when I start workout  cycling  using band  timer alone runs    Distance covered calories burnt steps remain on    After finishing workout  when I stop in band  it shows  Distance too short to be recorded   When workout is started from app  there is no such issue I have continuous heart rate monitoring ON and sleep tracking OFF in my band  Battery lasts just about     days  draining approximately        per day Cycling mode requires the phone to be near the band always  which means I have to carry the phone whenever I go cycling  For me  this defeats the purpose of the band because I can check distance covered and time taken using phone app itself  did not buy band to check time steps heart rate 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   do not buy     there is a major problem with battery life  Bought it on   th Nov  for   week lasted for   days but after latest update  battery life not even lasting one day  Heart rate   steps reading both are incorrect There is no backup option to restore it later in case to be restored to factory setting for bug fixing  All warranty   guarantee is via store visit  CS is of no help do not waste money  not worth           Update    dec After few days  major issue in display  When approached service center  they updated the band  No replacement as no stock from company s end  As per service center  display problem common with band   Strongly recommend not to buy   Jan update   it gets hanged  To correct that if you restart device  restart phone   nothing happens  If you unpair   repair  you will loose all day data   all settings done in ur MI app  Its a seriously pathetic band  do not GO FOR IT  you will regret it  Complete waste of money
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very good design  it feels good on had and easy to use  Sleep tracking is nicely improved and it is really helpful  But the step counting has some problems  every morning when I wake up  I see there are    to     steps already  May be I was walking in dreams  Mobile app needs to be improved by a significant amount  it is really not that good Otherwise in this price point  it is most perfect fitness band 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  i am facing problem to connect this device with mobile application  In starting it connected with samsung mobile but now not able to connect  I think this can connect with mobile app only in mi phones  I have also tried in honor phone but problem is same  Otherwise band is good but mi will have to work a lot on app 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This is my first fitness tracking band I thought to buy this because i want to stay away from my phone and at the same time not to miss any emergency call in case Today i am using for a complete   week and let me share my experience Battery life     per day I am using in a very heavy way Notification on  alarm on  cycling workout    hrs heart beat monitoring  etc The vibration is really strong and easily feel while driving too Sleep tracking It will give you the quality of your sleep and one interesting thing is REM  how long and how many dream you dreamt Nap is not satisfaction as sometime it record and sometime not Note They should provide screen protector along with the band I buy extra so that i fear there is high chances of scratch or damage anytime since we love to wear it almost all day and all works 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I rather prefer a band than the bigger dispay watch as it is more convenient to wear   has no discomfort that I experience with a bigger watch it is light weight  at times  I do not even notice it is on my wrist The battery life is exactly week which is fairly good based on my overall usage The band belt material is silicone rubber   has nice soft feel to it The overall tracking features are nice   the MI FIT app tracks everything pretty much accurately Synchronization of Band with MI FIT app is super fast in seconds Workout activities are detected automatically just after     minutes after you start with your regular workout   nice feature though If you are genuinely looking for a health tracking band I would suggest you this one as it comes at a steal price 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I never own a fitness band before  But due to pandemic I decided to have one to track my outdoor walk  jog and functional workouts So I decided to opt for it Pro   Amoled display  no lag shuffle between activities  App gives maximum details about fitness activities  easy to charge  long battery life  customise wallpaper Cons   Delicate display  inaccurate steps count  distortion in bluetooth earphone while listening songs if you are holding a mobile in the same hand where you wear a band  I do not know who is fault it is Fitness band can not keep you fit it is you who needs to follow fit lifestyle It just tracks your progress I am satisfied with the product 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Its a superbly good fitness band Tip  Use  Notify for Mi Band  for alot more face watches  I even bought the pro version
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Sleep monitoring is bad  I woke up for about an hour in middle but it is not tracked  I woke up at      and removed the band  the heart rate monitoring is enabled  even then it shows as sleeping when I even turned off an alarm at       I have not tested others
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The new Mi Smart Band   s overall aesthetic has not evolved much compared to its predecessors  It still has a capsule with a colour display and a thermoplastic elastomer wristband with a loop buckle  It is said to have approximately    per cent more display area than the Mi Smart Band    but that is hardly noticeable  there is a touch sensitive button below the     inch     x    pixels  AMOLED touchscreen  which has a    bit colour range  This is a downgrade from the    bit colour range of the Mi Smart Band   s display  However  the peak brightness has increased from    nits to    nits 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Being an user of MI Band I have been using it since the first band ever launched in market Probably the cheapest and best smart band available in market and I have seen so many people using this same band so nothing new to say about this I use it everytime only charging time it is not in my hand and totally satisfied with its performance Though  battery back up of Band   is not up to the mark but with so many new features you can not expect more The best part is magnetic charger so that you do not loose the cable Eagerly waiting for Band   to come 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Was unsure between Honor band   and this one   although from what I have gathered Honor band   is more precise but on the whole android  goodgle us   china tradewar issue and banning of huwaei and honor the huwae apps in near future might show irregularities  And the band best works if you have an honor phone Coming back to this one it is great You instantly become a fan to how many features are embedded and accuracy is very very good Looks good Sensitive Display is great And finally did not regret buying it for a sec 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  It seemed as an OK upgrade  After using the previous versions of Mi Bands The Mi Band    purchased in India  lasted barely   months  and Mi Band   purchased in the US for another family member lasted for nearly   years  I personally feel that the life of these entry level fitness bands is on an average   year  Now coming to this product  I will mention the Good OK Not So Good Good   Display  a decently bright OLED display   but it struggles a bit in the direct sunlight    Sleep Tracking   this is decent enough and felt an upgrade over the previous Mi Band      so far so good   Pairing with app   It was fast and easy OK   Charge   The charge lasts about a   days to week  with heart rate monitor and sleep tracking on   This is kind of OK considering that this is an OLED color display    Charging method   This is an improvement over the previous Mi Band    The magnetic charger gets stuck to theband and holds to the charging pins  A good change from Mi Band   where the contact with the pins and the charging saddle was not effective  But however  this would have been in the good category if the pins were replaced by a pure magnetic surface which intuitively gets attached to the band  However  no complaints No So Good   User Interface and traversal through the different screens  This is a bit difficult and confusing    Touch sensitivity   not that great  it needs two to three swipes to properly read the command and act accordingly Overall   If you are looking for a decent  dependable fitness band at entry level to monitor the steps  heart rate and sleep tracking and intend to upgrade in about an year  then this a decent purchase  However  there are some smart watches from other bands like Amazfit  Noise Goki which start at       to      which look decent  So  it your call
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I purchased Boat Enigma  Noise and MI Band    And believe me  MI Band   is accurate  Looks minimalist and is easy to use  I go for walking  I do cycling and also hit the gym once a week  the trackers that are available is useful and worth every cent that you give  I have retirned the remaining   gadgets and preferred to retain MI Band   as it does fulfill all my needs being a software engineer with physical activities ranging from walking cycling and gym  you never know that you are wearing it as it is very light and the MI FIT app is helpful and also gets frequent updates so there are no bugs 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best fitness smart tracker on this price range  You get almost all the features you expect from smart tracker on this price range  Fits perfectly  Regarding accuracy if your into fitness just buy this for motivation do not be completely reliable on a smart tracker irrespective of the brand they all only       percent only accurate  Connect with the mobile via Bluetooth seemingly push app notification perfectly  Using third party apps you can get infinite number of watch faces  And also you can so much things using this band using third party apps  One thing that make mi band stand out of the crowd is support from community and individual developers which you can not get with other bands
Smartdevices,1,OR,  See the product is awesome and full of features  it is one of the the best watch but if you are buying it on Amazon s seller  Appario Retail Private Ltd  Then this would be a mistake because I bought it on Amazon by the same seller I received the package in   days COD   I opened it and saw a    rupees light watch which was blinking and showing time This was the worst experience ever Note  Take It seriouslyPS  If you love your money then do not spend it on that seller 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Battery Life in Band   has decreased to    Days as compared to Band   which has    Days Cons   pedometer accuracy is worse  Walk   steps and it counts it as       steps   HeartRate Meter also varies      BPM  There are so many modes of activities like running  swimming  playing  etc  Adding activities is just playing around with calculating algorithm  These are not worth increasing a product price Pros   Magnetic Charging  Though it may not seem important  but trust me it is  having to remove the device out of the band for charging was a huge demerit    PAISummary  do not waste money on any future Mi Bands as all of them have the same hardware technology in it  Only thing that differs is there are new calculating algorithms being added in each new version  Not worth it However that does not mean it is not good for anyone  you should get one and do not buy another until they do a major hardware upgrade if accuracy is your thing 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  It is best in the price segment   but it disappointed in terms of battery  Xiaomi claims   days of battery without turning on the special features which I have done  Notification Off  Heartrate monitoring off  PAI off  Sleep tracking Off but it remains lastly  days or   hardly  Accuracy is     because if you do any action with moving hands it counts as a step which I do not like  Mobile app does not sync it automatically you have to launch Fitness app atleast twice a day then you will get calls and reminder notification on screen  Sometimes it does not track accurate heart reading while work out or Walking etc  I know I am taking it too personal regarding drawbacks but Xiaomi has claimed that from which I got impressed and bought this as always from Xiaomi  No personal grudges 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I do not know if its a false use case  but heart rate shows      supposed to be zero if am not wearing it  And steps are not very accurate  Those are my only cons PROS  The watch looks incredibly awesome  definitely upgrades your look  The watch is very useful if you want to quickly look at notifications calls that you receive  say while riding bike     stars for that actually  You can silence it or reject the call  Battery is excellent even if I set to measure heat rate every    min  it will last a week  guess   Music controls  play pause   volume    stars  I use Redmi Note   pro  There are lots of options for workout  have not checked  but they are 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Its good for beginners  has almost good tracking accuracy if not perfect   Been using for    days  I noticed something odd or not sure if I am missing something  The workout tracking when i turned on from app was working perfectly with GPS  however when I started the same from the band it was totally inaccurate like   within few steps it was recording a km   and gets disconnected frequently  Battery backup is not great as advertised  the charge percentage falls even when band is idle  this was not the case with HRX version i used earlier   Battery holds good only for using steps calculation  Using workout tracking  changing watch faces  heart rate monitoring etc seems to be draining the battery a lot  Yet to check Sleep monitor  But atleast the magnetic charging us helpful compared to old charging mechanism which was frustrating  Its overall ok product 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Decently accurate  It does show a few steps when you wake up but that is considering your heart rate and the sleep movements you had in bed But yeah the stress thing did not work for a few days after the latest update And the battery lasts   days with all the  battery consuming  settings turned on The step count and the sleep tracking is     accurate is what I would say I are not no fitness freak so I am more than ok with it  The watch faces are great with a third party all ofc I got it for    k and I guess it is a pretty good deal 
Smartdevices,4,OR,    With all features on like each minute heart rate tracking  battery lasts    days  I do not mind charging once a week  roughly   Very easy charging port  magnetic   Display super bright  adjustable  even in sunshine  Customisable UI  you can rearrange items per your liking  set backgrounds if you are into them  have not yet notoced any inaccuracies in heart rate tracking  pedometer and sleep tracking  They seem reasonably accurate  Google fit recognises sleep  heart rate and steps data from MI fit  More analysis for same set of data   Worried about searches as the glass specs are not promising  Got an opened box  The band itself was in a packed pouch  hence not returning it  Worried about privacy invasion as the app is Chinese and servers might be in China
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Other than Samsung and Apple nothing works perfect  However for an average calculation this watch is OK  Not the best and definitely not the disappointed watch  Its decent and serves purpose at an average level like any other peer brands  After all you will not get all features at little cost  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I bought honor band   and mi band    Honor is best bend in terms of features  Honor band have double battary life than mi band    Like honor band will come   days with continuous heart rate monitor and mi will come for only   days  Battary charging time also mi taking very long time  But I like the watch faces in mi band  Stress monitoring is not calculating continuously  And breathe monetaring also not good 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Overall built quality is very good  Looks very nice  Display type excellent  Straps is rubber made and very much comfortable  do not worry for water damage  because it is waterproof  Overall I am satisfied  Step counting is satisfactory  but during car or bike driving it gives maximum false counting   But sleep monitoring and other features are satisfactory  After using continuously for two days and   minutes interval heart rate monitoring   now it still     battery remains  Overall I am satisfied after using for   days 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Hey Guyzz  I purchased it on flash sales  And this is for you  My ReviewUsing about   month  no scratch and damages  design wise its awesome  That glossy black  waterproof      reliable  I used it for swimming  out door run tracking is awesome  all modes of workouts are calculated with your heart rate  am using it connected with iphone  ios users pls note  The Mi band app will drain your battery like Bolt  call and message notifications are clear and fast  the band strap is nice and durable  note  there is no spo  sensor   battery life about    days for normal usage  display is bright and clear  sleep tracking is just awesome   idle alert are awesomeGo for it  Thank You
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am using it for a month now  It works as it says  I love the battery backup  I do not connect to bluetooth untill m stepping out from home  Being at home during tthis covid time  Its battery lasted for    days Step count is accurate and useful when I actually walk  but it also count steps when m sitting and working with my hands  I apply normal subtraction to get genuine step count  But dt much is acceptable for me  Heart rate sensor is working quite accurately  It automatically measures heart rate in sometime  Best to be used as night watch  It reminds when I sit for long without activity  I still need to explore other features  Overall m satisfied as of now  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Writing the review after    days of usage    The step counter is not that accurate  There is a huge difference in the MiFit  Google Fit and Samsung Health   The step counter will also count your sleep walk    The workout feature of the band is totally useless  It does not work if you are not connected with mobile phone and It will give false readings  I used Walk Mode and after every kms the device vibrates  I was surprised to see the variations in my speed of walking which ranges from   kmph to wooping   kmph    While Google Fit recorded a total of    kms of walk  MiFit recorded   kms in Walk Mode    Heart Rate sensor is OK    There is no feature that measures blood oxygen level   PAI feature is still out of my understanding I will update the review  if any interesting feature is discovered 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Review after using    days My battery is still     after    daysPros    nice design   good battery life   sleep tracking   I love it     value for money   accuracy not much sure    display is cool   comfortable and easy to wear   waterproofCons     rd class packaging  no proper care ever its value is    k    interfare with my Bluetooth gamepad and i lag alote while playing games  Hate this as i can not disconnect this band  If i disconnect  it automatically pairs and if i unpair band all of my data get erase Hate this thing so much  Mi must allow us to disconnect band from phone even my bluetooth is on I hate this hate this hate this sssooo much   no response to my complaint made in mi fit app  They do not care about our complaint    paying rs     more than Chinese users even for less features than chinese version   not made in india
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I had an excellent time using Mi Band   so skipped a generation and went for Band    they have improved in almost all aspects except battery life and the front glass durability My Mi Band   lasts nearly a month or more on full charge when not using BT  whereas this drops to     battery in just   days Been using the Mi Band   roughly for nearly    years now  without a screen protector and it barely has a scratch on it till now  I took Band   outside for a run and by the time I came back  it already had nearly   clearly visible scratches on the front  Not durable at all  Xiaomi should either provide a screen protector or use durable glass like the one in Band   for their next product Functionality wise  I tried the Indoor Cycling workout and it was highly inaccurate  Apparently  I burned     calories in the span of    minutes  which is completely inaccurate   Step tracking is somewhat accurate though 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Truly speaking   I was willing to have a smart watch  so after some research I got to know that this one will be good for me  So I bought one  So the experience is very hilarious   Positive side    Looks premium  Loved it    Too light weight  Handy enough    Battery back is quite good    Text messages are shown on the band Negative side     It does not provide any true value reading    it is totally fake  How Ok let me explain  Even without touching my wrist to the band  it aslo shows heartrate value reading   is not funny  Lol How does this monitor my heart rate even without touching my body surface    As I use to go for gym  their after heavy workout also it does not show the right heart rate reading     Watch faces are limited   Very few watch faces are good    It does not track gym home activities  workout  automatically     Only text messages are shown on the band  I wished to get at least notifications of other social media    Sleep tracking is totally fake  If I do not wear the band  then also it shows results   Fake Waste of money to bye a fake smart watch 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Hi I have been using Mi band   last    days  The only issue I am facing is battery draining  And the main reason is Auto heart rate sensor is working even after turned this feature off on the mi Fit app  Sensor lights are flashing randomly though it is turned off  This is so frustrating  I am not a heavy user  But it consumes     charge for     hrs of uses  ACCURACY is not that great or bad  In my opinion Go for Galaxy Fit   which is cost      
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Where is the warranty card or bill     Not able to find where is the warranty card or bill
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Super Cool band   Main Highlight   Big Screen n Working fine in SunlightComfort   Lightweight n Very Comfortable in all day use  Sensors  Accuracy   Heart Rate   Fine   Sleeping Accuracy   Very Gud  Step Counting   Always       steps extra while you noticing   But getting increase more n more with hands movement while sitting   etcLooks   Quite GudBattery       days   Heavy Use           days  normal use Display   Very smooth n No worry for scratchesCharging is Quite  Easy    Buy or Not   If very focused on fitness tracking accuracy  little disappointing   but Rest features  No doubt are enough for buying  that is why i did not return it    
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Sleep tracking is Fine  Mobile app is laggy and Often does not synchronise with the Band so it sucks for me  accuracy definitely you should take it     for step counting for sure  But Rope jumping was quite accurate and so was i would say walking or running   There should have been a Default option of Hanging the call with sms and Answering the call instead of mute button  Because for these two I had to buy     rs pro features from Notify for mi band app 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am writing this review just after    hours of use of this product Since I have purchased a smart fitness band first time I was not very much familiar with its usability but my experience with mi band   is overall good The pairing process is quite easy  steps counting is quite accurate but sometimes it picks up        false step counts when I travel on a vehicle  heart rate sensor works well and the stress level calculation is a nice feature to keep a watch on high stress levels which could lead to severe illnesses relaxed breathing feature is very good to control our high stress levels  screen resolution and brightness level is excellent no visibility issue in broad daylight  notifications come instantly and you can read whatsapp as well as other messages on the band itself So far a nice fitness band smart watch for the budget conscious user The only improvements I feel could be done are battery life decreased from          in two days only with continuous heart rate monitoring which may last for     days but it should be at least    days and the font size is very small which makes it difficult to read messages 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  First of all i am using fitness band for the first time   I charged the band to      exactly   day before the band and it is the  th day from the day which i started to use the band  I have been wearing this all time except at the time of bathing  It is water proof you can wear it even when bathing there is no problem  My girlfriend was always playing with the heart rate and stress monitor and all the functions of the band was enabled   x  and i was working out daily  even after that there is still     of charge left so battery is good the screen attracts too much finger print and the screen scratches fast so it is better to spend some more to get a screen protector  It is far more better than band   compared with it because my friend has that band  Heart rate is kind of okeish  and stress is for just gimmicking  Sleep monitoring works just fine  Build quality is great  Strap is not irritating but wearing too tightly every time can because sweating  Strap quality is fine but i think it will last  You can get notifications can change songs  It is purposeful  I would say if you want it then buy it but use it for what is meant to be  Or else just do not buy it   It would be better to look for a good looking branded normal watch  If looks are matter to you rather than purpose   You can save   custom wallpaper    have its own font template which you can not change but you can change colour of fonts   I hope the band will last for atleast   years  You can clearly see the screen even at noon in the sunlight so no issue with that  If you want just go for it without thinking twice or Just do not buy this  that is the only thing I can say 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Its been exactly   days now since I got this product and I liked it  Its very useful and fully worth the money With its slim and sleek style Its very comfortable on the wrist  Has good build quality  Has vivid and crispy display It basically has all the features that is mentioned in the description and works pretty accurately  sleep tracking  heart rate  step tracking etc The battery backup is very good  It takes approximately around     hr to   hr to charge       The battery backup in the description is mentioned as   days however it gave me   days in One charge and I think its only because I have turned on all the apps notifications  It vibrates on each and every notifications which I think drains out the battery pretty quick So turn off all the unnecessary notifications to avoid unnecessary battery drainage Overall the product is very very good and valuable according to its price  You should definitely go for it The only reason I think someone might give a second thought on buying this product is just because its a Chinese product  that is it  Otherwise its awesome device   I am satisfied with my money spent on this Hope you all find it helpful 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I am new to this fitness band culture  so if anyone who is planning to start with this one its a good product  but i beleive it fakes where it tells you that  the device can do sleep tracking  how did i catch that    as i work in night shift i sleep during the day time so it does not even catch the record that i have even slept  you will have yo add manually that you have slept Most important glitch of the interface you will realise it when yiu use the activity tracker the time when you ride a cycle and you want to us the watch to take click or change music or just use the normal watch  it does not work Once the activity tracker is started or even if it is paused you cannot use otger feature that is a real turn off 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This is a good product overall however the accuracy is not that perfect     on the very first day i wore it and was travelling on bike and it displayed the steps   moreover in order to save battery i will say not to turn on the PAI   but anyhow this has got a good feel and more or less very beneficial in taking your fitness journey a level up
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is a feature rich  smartly priced smart band which is light and works great  Coloured OLED display is also great and has good display area Most impressive update was new magnetic charging which increases silicon band s longevity too Sleep tracking was good  heart rate monitor was also impressive  Battery life is fair around      days  Vibration is great for alarm 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  First thing I want say  this band is simply awesome   Look is very great  it is sturdy and has    Dcurved glass  Strap quality is awesome   Battery is monster  it gives backup up to    days   UI which is an important thing  is very good and user friendly  which is a plus point   Accuracy is up to the mark  it tracks every sports with great accuracy   The great success of mi fitness bands is it is app  mi fit  It is well designed app and is user friendly  And has lots of features making it cross the limits Overall this is the best fitness band  And highly recommend 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am absolutely satisfied with the product  Battery life is really great  Display is larger than previous versions of MI Band  Display is Super smooth as well  What I liked most is that it has so many cool functionalities within this price range except the SpO  monitor   It has stress monitoring  PAI monitoring as well as camera shoot option  Water proof tested in shower  It is working absolutely fine with great accuracy calculating all health datas 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Loved The all new Mi Smart Band   I have been using it for about a week now Here are Some Pros   Cons  Very Comfortable feel light weight Stylish Good display Brighter even in direct Sunlight Accuracy is Fine Magnetic Charging is Super Cool But Battery drains too quickly Maybe Just for a week According to enabled functions Watch Faces are really Nice But they are limited in the Mi Fit App you will be able to find more in Third party apps Suggestion only    workout Modes that is Cool PAI Is also Fine Well The Mi Fit app is overall okay The screen is much durable without a screen guard Waterproof upto   M I really loved this Mi Band   because this is my first smartband and is much cost effective and budget friendly than other available ones On the Contrary The Mi Smart Band   is totally Worth the money All the features Are Splendid Best Recommended For Students But before buying it Make sure to read the description and Reviews Great ProductGo for it  Will Give updates Shortly  Hope this helped  Thanks for Reading 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Superb quality and premium feel touch   more accurate than any other bands in the market   caliculating intermittent sleep and automatic excercise   delivered in   days   I am the first reviewer  Was using band    must recommend for band   users 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was not sure whether to go for this product at first  However  after reading all positive customers  reviews and introspecting for      days  I finally ordered a pair of Mi smart bands  one for myself and another one for my husband  Guess what   Its been    days from the date I received these bands  its still    percent charged  It has wow battery storage  I charged it      on  st December and today its  wth December and I have not charged it yet  Additionally  it tracks your heartbeat  stress level  menstruation cycle of women  calorie count  sleep patterns  I have not tried sleep detection as I feel that wearing smart band while sleeping actual affects my sleep In nutshell  I must say that this is an amazing build quality  extreme soft touch screen and accurate product ar budget friendly rate  I have become even more concerned about my health after wearing this band 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I doubt that in the official video of this band  They claim two battery modes  I did not understand that point  I do not find any such thing for   months  And normally just by turning on notifications and alarms  And putting brightness to   out of    My band goes for   complete days in     to zero percent     days is not possible until you turn off the Bluetooth and disconnect the band from the app and phone but still wearing it for heart rate not automatic but manually checking purpose 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The band is good in terms of built and design  but when it comes to accuracy  the most important part of the band  it is quite inaccurate  step count is more accurate  almost       in Samsung health app compared to band  And the heart rate is kind of accurate  but it somehow measures the heart rate of air   it displays the heart rate value even when it is not attached to anything  When it comes to battery it is used up    in    hours of use with continues heart rate monitoring  I have not used the sleep tracking yet so I can not comment on it Design and build      Connectivity and features    Accuracy    Battery life      
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not waste money to buy it Very poor quality strap grip Locking opens from your wrist so slightly that you even can not think of it There is only one small point where it get locked that looses its grip in the hole and it fell down immediately No other option to stop it from opening  So careful person like me can lose it within a week after buying it No sense of appreciating the quality of its software when you lose the hardware so easily 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  positives   battery backup is good     drop per day with full monitoring enabled  set to medium brightness  so expecting    days backup  charging the band is very easy  lots of band faces choice    rd party also available  lots of choice and options to control the device  notifications etc  indepth view of weather  step count of week etcnegatives my wife has honor band     will compare with it   stress monitoring is gimmick   i am sure about it  its inaccurate  misses on spo  feature  ui  fluidity is better on honori cannot comment on heart rate monitor as i did not have source to compareover all i feel honor band   is value for money product  i feel mi band   is above average and its over rated on internet reviews
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good one  can not detect Naps now   Hoping it will fix with update  Otherwise everything is goood          jada le lete par spo  v daal dete yrr 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The step tracking is highly inaccurate   the steps counted and distance covered is less than    percentage compared to actuals  The sleep tracking is also inaccurate  sleep time shown is nearly       percentage less  It is rather surprising that mi band   is getting glowing reviews inspite of being accurate  Honor band   is more accurate compared to mi band   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am a smart watch user since last   to   years and do not want to spend a lot for my another watch  This am primarily going to use to see the call and message notification in an crowded places where phone ring will not be heard  along the side i am also planning to use the walk tracker  though more features are there am not much interested over them   As far as is know  and see the product is amazing and is upto my requirement which is the same as said above and am in love with the AMOLED screen this device has which is one of the USP of this product      Small but crisp and precise      Got job to the seller  as of today   Good job Amazon  very fast express delivery  and go job Delivery partners  very fast first slot delivery 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Amazing product  Compared to mi   version  band   gives more accurate readings  Sleep tracking is so nice which also gives REM  But the step out and distance covered found to inaccurate  However this is the best band for this price range  Magnetic coupled charger is also an amazing feature of mi band  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I had been using the fitbit HR for a while and then read about this cost effective  great tracker from MI  frankly it does not measure up at all  If you are a first time user  it might be worth while  I just do not find it accurate enough in any area  be it counting steps  heart rate monitoring or stress monitoring  It is supposed to be feature loaded  but if it does not do what it is supposed to primarily do  then its useless  I just use it as a watch most of the time   So do not buy it  if you are serious about daily tracking 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Satisfied with it  only there ia one problem that strap is not so secure  I have lost my mi band   due to the strap lock and the same is being used in mi band    but everything else is perfect  I would appreciate if there would be a SPO  sensor but anyways its awesome
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Not too good not too badAlthough the band itself is fine  built quality is kind of low you will certainly feel that the strap could break and scratches will appear on regular basis usage it does not matter if you sleep it with the band on or not the screen will get scratched but it does not make it less valuableAnd one important thing  Whatever you do with this band the battery will reduce   You increase brightness  the battery will reduce   You use heart tracking  the battery will reduce   You use pedometer  the battery will drain  Even if gives hilariously wrong data   You use animated watch face do not EVEN THINK ABOUT ITTHE BATTERY WILL DRAIN LIKE CRAZYJust tie it up  use it for watching time and nothing more then the battery will last for       daysSo nothing special just another hyped products from Mi
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Needs full movement of arms to track steps  overall tracking of steps average does not have SPO  meter Stress tracking needs person to be extremely stationary Sleep tracking average  nap tracking does not detect naps Overall performance satisfactory for a budget band  advised to invest a little more and go for a professional performance basic band like Fitbit 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Have used and observed the band since October       The band does not accurately register body movements  Seems that the sensors are not very efficient  Particularly  in Treadmill exercise mode  the band fails to accurately register distance and it pauses several times at its will  This is despite disabling the auto pause option  The heart rate sensor also keeps giving false alarms of high BPM  may be because of the movement of band on wrist 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Been using this everyday and I must say that I am very impressed with the battery   I did not have to worry about taking a charger with me on trips at all  The sleep tracker is very detailed  the step counter and various other activity trackers seem accurate  the notifications are quick and handy  It is not as bulky as I was worried it would be on leaner wrists  do not hesitate to buy this one 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I bought on the first day first sale and one month has completed and it is working expected with all feature which is listed in the description like a lift to wake  timer  stopwatch  the weather up to   days  Receive notifications from the phone  notifications  Reject and silent calls  and change the brightness of the band from the band itself The only concern is that the battery life is not two weeks since I recharge three times a month and I feel that sleeping mode is not correct 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Heartbeat accuracy is bit late      during workout it stays almost constant at start and when my heartbeat reaches to around   bpm it shows   bpm      when i take rest in between repetition that time it shows    bpm     so basically it works with accuracy and record correctly but not instantly Steps counts is always      steps when i wakeup from dreams     Sleep monitor is accurate      do not know how it measures but tells all the detail when i wake up and open my fit app If you want accurate monitoring in realtime during workout sessions you can manually select your workout mode from its menu which is easy but daily opening it and selecting start and stop is not my cup of tea    i prefer it mainly for sleep monitoring that is done perfectly fine for me display quality is best of its segment      whatsapp messages can not be read directly through this      battery backup is awesome        week without any issue in single charge   
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Basic feature is the step count  which is not accurate i wonder from where and how the step count goes up  Not sure if other feature is working accurately 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The product is excellent for this price  had matched data with other devices almost accurate  strap is comfortable my watch gave me backup of   days after   month use  with   minute heart rate monitor on and rem sleep data on  Workout monitor is nice some monitor are based on heart rate and time data  guess  but heart rate detection goes haywire and inaccurate while workout  gps is used from phone   rd party watch face are also good  nice to have custom vibration for device  display is also nice with nice pixel density  Unable to sync excercise data with google fit only steps  sleep data compaired with mi band   were different  no spo  monitor Overall should have device in my opinion  if you want to have fitness tracker 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is my first mi band  so do not know any changes what it is having from predecessors   my point of view is Very Good Band and new magnetic charging cable is so easy and convenient to charge on the go anytime and anywhere Custom Image for the watch face is very good  Syncing with is very easy  one thing is it is Bluetooth pairing for taking photos with band is not working for me maybe my phone is supporting I guess I use Redmi note   For a normal day to day usage it is very good   yet to check out sports mode one by one 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Slightly improved than band   but one of the best mi bands interm of accuracy  tracking and charging   mobile app is also good  but very easily scratchable so better to but screen protector  will surely lasts for more than a week with all features turned on  battery capacity could have been increased but surprisingly battery capacity is lower than band   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am so excited to have this product  Thank you Amazon  Had arrived ma courier within   days   According to ma location it is hard to receive products   Loved this product a lot  Had slept with ma band  And the amazing that I had recognized is that it had measured ma sleeping duration  Every features are unique  Loved it    I am so glad cuz thru flash sale I am the first to have this 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  this is one of the budget fit band by MI  amolded display is awesome  battery last for   to   days at normal usage  sleep tracking is not so accurate  heart rate tracker is ok best for beginners not recommended to professionals fitness freaks
Smartdevices,5,OR,  It is my first MI BAND and it is just amazing  Liked it very much  Review after    days of use  Battery is still      So I think it will give more     days Pros    Accurate HEART TRACKING and STRESS MEASURING  It was same when I measured using the band and a pulse monitoring device at the same time    Accurate Sleep tracking  it is sleep tracking is too accurate    Battery life Though the battery capacity is decreased but it gives you       days battery life and charges within   hours    Strap is very comfortable and PREMIUM  If you wear it you will not feel that much pressure on your hand    Unlimited watch faces    CAMERA   MUSIC features are working very well  World clock is also there Cons    SpO  is not their  But not a great deal for me    Battery capacity is decreased instead  of increasing  But then also it gives you a good battery life    The pin lock setting is not their which was previously present in mi band    May be available in the next updates All over it is a good smart band and one of the best budget fitness band Recommended for all Every one can buy it 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Well guys if you want a cheap product like I wanted please go for the same  You will get all decent features within your tracker including  stress monitoring   heart beat   PAI   multiple sports  modes etc  but in terms of accuracy it lags  Frankly speaking I have not used any other fitness tracker of any other brand so I can not say whether they are better performing in this range Now let me tell you where it lagsSports Mode   in all the sports mode it has gives fairly correct details including steps calculation  however you are doing strength training in gym it fails to add anything towards counting of your steps Steps Calculator   well if you keep motion detection or activity detection all the time I do not know it counts your steps  Recently I was on a road trip by car we went through a bad patch of road for almost   hours and it calculated them as steps as if I am walking Sleep tracker   Well it is pretty decent but at times it is unable to differentiate whether I am sleeping or just lying on bed and timings of sleep on certain days are inaccurate  Additionally the MI fit app is no good as it has not improved much over the years Heart Beat   Well its accurate at times but at times I noticed during my strength training in gym when I am pretty sure that my heart beat is high it shows as normal Stress Monitoring   it is just a namesake feature and it can not accurately predict the mental stress you are going throughTouch Interface   very poor  At times it does not wakes up even after touching few times and at night if the screen gets accidental touches anywhere it just wakes up  Some kind of accidental touch feature should be there So guys please think before putting your money on this and please do not get lured to review videos on YouTube where they get paid for providing positive reviews 
Smartdevices,5,OR,     The box was slightly crumpled when I received the product  That was probably the reason why the seal was partially broken  All the contents were fine though    Fit and comfort        The band fits fine  The strap material feels quite comfortable on skin  The shape of the tracker could have been a bit curved like the Honor Band      Mobile app      Read the instructions on the manual and download the Mi Fit app from the Playstore  The UI of the app is quite intuitive and the detailed stats are presented in various graphical illustrations  You can also connect the Google Fit app with it    Display        The AMOLED display is really good and is quite bright  For indoor usage  around        brightness will be sufficient  Under direct sunlight  you will need to increase the brightness  Outdoor visibility at peak brightness is great  Touch response of the display works properly    Activity tracking      The tracker can count steps with more than     accuracy  Only problem is that it counts steps even when you are travelling by a car or a bus  I could not check the accuracy for other sports modes  but it does a fine job for walking    Heart rate        I ve compared it with a pulse oximeter under various circumstances  I am really impressed with the heart rate sensor on this band  it is pretty accurate  with a deviation of     BPM which is negligible    Sleep tracking        This fitness band tracks sleep quite accurately  It can also track your daytime naps    Water resistance      It has   atm or    m water resistance  You can shower with it without any worries  I have showered with it for a week  and there are no issues    Battery life      After a week of heavy usage  with automatic HR and sleep tracking turned on  and HR being measured every minute   notifications turned on  and brightness set to        most of the time  the band had     battery left after   days of use  So you can expect     days of battery life with heavy usage  You can improve battery life by setting a higher interval for HR measurement  It took me around     hours to charge the band from          Also the magnetic charger is really convenient     Features      The PAI is a nice feature to have especially for fitness enthusiasts  The camera and music controls work flawlessly  The breathing exercises can be useful for many people  The stress monitoring feature works well too Conclusion   it is a value for money product  I even got a discount of INR     from the seller during the Diwali Sale  Remember  it is a budget fitness tracker  It does what a fitness band is supposed to do and more  Personally I do not miss the SpO  sensor as the ones found on the budget fitness bands are usually not that accurate  All in all  even for the selling price of INR       I would easily recommend it to anyone P  S    Please note that no warranty information is mentioned in the product description  I confirmed with a Mi Store that we will get   year warranty on the tracker and no warranty on the strap 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The band is working well  This accuracy in this rate is really economically sounded well   Step tracking does not show the real data   Sleep tracking is a very good feature  It shows deep sleeping too  Sleep tracker will not work while we travel long distance in train  Accuracy in heart rating is really awsome  Design of watch is good  mi can provide better stylish shape according to my personal view   Light wieght  comfortable enough to wear   App has good features and many watch faces  I found some bugs in notify for mi band app   We can link it with google fitness app and some of third party appsOver all  I am quiet happy with mi band   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Have been using for a while   menstrual cycle tracker  breathing exercise  stress measure  some additional workout tracker like yoga  and rem sleep in sleep tracker  magnetic charger are some additional features to mi band   Step counter sometimes counts steps while driving or moving arms too much but mostly accurateBattery life is good   i charge it every   weeks or so
Smartdevices,4,OR,  All good        But I have disappointed after seeing that my band also track my heart rate when I have not put the band on my hand and auto heart rate tracking is on     And   And there is one more problem in the mi fit app that    when I was connects the band to app the app ask for weight and height     I have entered my height     feet and by mistake entered weight as    kg   But the app accept it   That my weight is as much low  And also do not tell me that I have to do what     During low weight  Battery life is about   days when I use it by keeping all the features onn    
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Smart Watch  It is smart but not even close to proper watch  Not much to say for its purpose What Disappoint most isStop Watch  it stops at   th minute  It must be at least    hrs  to Track how many hours one is investing in useful work study  Timer  It will give COUNTDOWN TIMER FOR    minutes   How many  Total Hours one wants to invest in particular work study  note Once you enter into either timer or stopwatch  you have to tolerate it  You can not move to other apps or any other feature while timer or stop watch is running   not even for microsecondAt least timer or stopwatch must be minimizedMi Team must work on this 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros    Lot of watch faces available   Lots of different workout modes added   Magnetic charging   Sleep monitoring  Stress monitoring  Continous heart rate monitoring   Screen is little bigger and looks goodCons    Strap feels thinner than band     Some watch faces from store looks dull on screenUpdate   Worth the money  Accuracy is far better than band     Battery backup is excellent  After more than   weeks of usage still have    percent left without continuous monitoring   Need to check with monitoring ON also  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Heart rate monitor still gives you a reading when it is not wearing the band  attached to ur body  sleep monitor is not accurate  nap time is not accounted  battery life is   to   days if you use heart rate and sleep tracker  steps counts it is always on a higher end  stress detection is fake  I feel ppl who wants to buy a digital watch to see time and view notifications of calls and msgs should buy it apart form that all fitness settings are just based assumptions  you on it and it will start talking reading you work out or not does not effects the out come
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Like    Touch   Fitness Features   Magnetic charging   Decent battery backup   Decent water resistance Dislike    Display is not good enuf size  It doesn  even cover the whole band area   No option to fully customize  but background image can be customized alone    Notification reading and scrolling is  little difficult because of small display size   Not very accurate           
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Band quality is good in outside  but there are many problem inside like step counter  heartreat taking  when i was sleeping the band track my footsteps     meters how do not know how  It also heart tracks when i was not wear it lol  but amazon service is very good  it delivered in    hours that is great and when i return it they refund in just   hours  Thanks amazon
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros  Display is pretty bright and punchy    touch response is fluid    connectivity from phone is good and gets notification in real time     pretty decent looking and comfortable   latest ui and product    heart rate monitoring is good    media control from band is on time Cons    bad sleep tracking in day time      will not track the day time naps    no spo  sensor   it is subjective  VerdictIf you want to use band for sleep tracking in particular it is not for you If you want to use it as a fitness band and gadget for regular use its decent buy if you do not have any fitness band right now or never used one it is new and decent 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I am using this product for more than a month  While using the walking workout mode  device automatically pauses and restarts  For the same route  distance and time taken  recorded distance and time taken are atleast       lesser than actual figures  No response from company for the compliants made Initially I got a used product shipped as new condition  after noticing the compliant returned the product and received a brand new condition  Problem was same in both Smart bands Is good for recording sleep trackings  idle warnings  I have not tried other workout modes  so do not have view regarding problems if any in other trackings
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Features mentioned in mi band   is working good  Screen quality is superb quality of strap is also good Acurracy of heart rate sensor  step counter and stress monitor is good i did not expect this much accuracy it does the job very mobile app mi fit app  also compliments the performance of mi band    sleep monitor works perfectly well and it gives the complete information of sleep activity  Battery is also good  with one full charge it gives you    days of battery life  if you use the activities lesser then it will last up to   days  depends on the usage   overall battery performance and accuracy is much good than expected  If someone need budget smartband then you can buy it  it is definitely value for money 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have used mi band hrx edition for around   year and now I upgraded to mi band   so here I will just tell you my experience after comparing both Mi band hrx edition    Built quality is good        accurate   after using for months display got some scratches   battery backup is    to    days for using all features   sleep tracking is quite accurate  touch is not so responsive   brightness is very low Mi band     built quality of band  not capsule is be worst than mi band hrx edition  that is why I am giving it   stars otherwise it is good       accurate   display of capsule is very good   battery backup is same    to    days using all features on   sleep tracking is accurate    touch is very responsive    brightness is much better and good tha hrx edition  Overall under     rs this is the best band in this budget 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was uncertain when I bought this band because of the reviews written by people but this watch is actually great if you have doubts let me assure you that it is one of the best fitness bands on Amazon  I will list some pros and consPROS      amazing battery life it has been   days from when I last charged it is       easy charging   good display   looks nice   step counting is not perfect      accurate     all the workout modes are great     the app is great and easy to use settings are quiet simple  MI Fit app    the music controlling feature comes handy while working out and walking instead of reaching out to your phone tochnage the song you can just use the watch as someone who likes to listent to music I like that featureCONS     For me one of the biggest cons is that it only counts steps when your hand is moving   for instance when the watch first arrived I thought it was defected because it was not counting steps but as soon as I started moving my hands steps increases   I have not had problems with the step counting since then     on the first day I wore the watch the strap got sweaty easily causing itching and redness but after you adjust to the watch it does not happen     the display is smaller than it looks  There are some features that I have not used sleep tracking  I do not wear the watch when I sleep   and PAI   I personally do not understand what it does   DND  do not know what that is  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best fitness tracker in      range  Display is very good  Many bands use other color displays which are bad but here you get amoled display and every watch face cools fantastic  Heart rate is very accurate  Steps and distance is also     accurate  Sleep calculation requires you wear it tight enough otherwise it might not calculate properly  It has all workouts which a person might need who goes to gym 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Well it is been a couple of months now I am using this so I am going to here are some pros and cons according to me in it  but seeing it is price  you can ignore  them cuz they were for me  not necessarily for all since my phone was pretty ancient as compared to new ones out there and probably that is why it lost connection pretty often and sometimes it even did not paired for some days  Otherwise it was quick  it is accuracy do raises eyebrows some times but not much I guess it is worth if you need A TRACKER and not A WATCH look out for that if you think like that that cuz yep it is amoled and has got good nits of brightness but duh   the screen s still less than my damn thumb    as a fitness tracker it is a GO  but a NO as watch Magnetic charging is pretty fast I would say and battery can last for like a week with more that     left IF sleep monitoring is OFF Would have been OP if bezels were less but yeah okayTHE VERDICT  If tight on budget it is good  but if you are having till  K  K go for the big ones only because of size P S  spO  really does not matter cuz in most of them  it is stupidly wrongHasta la vasta 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was waiting for its launch since it debuted in China and I am happy to report that it was worth the wait  I have previously owned mi band   and have not used smart band of other brands so it would be unfair to do comparisons  Well I guess anyone purchasing this product would be satisfied for the value it offers 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This product is a healthy choice can not promise precise accuracy but it does affect your mentality to do more activity and at this price one is getting what it is worth of  Really liked this product  especially sleep data It just gives you insight how much you sleep  how much ur body do movements Mobile app is wonderful very friendly you can also tracks your friends activity by adding them Display is very nice if it had spo  levels would have been great but still getting all these features at this cost is amazing buy most important it is healthy habit and it is really worth it Must buy for fitness freaks 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Awesome band   I have used mi band   and    Just switched to mi band   and the feeling is amazing  The improvements from band   to band   are phenomenol  The watch faces gives us a lot of info which is somewhat useful  PAI score is the more amazing part  It gives us a sort of motivation to keep the score high  which in turn gives us reason to do workout everyday Pros DisplayBatteryPAI scoreSleep tracking is accurateHeart rate is very goodStress level is goodMusic controlCamera controlCons  not many  but if I have to say Steps are sometimes a little bit offThat s all from my side  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Battery     if you use heartrate tracking for every    mins it will drain like hell and need to charge every  th or  th day Display     Its bright and awesome even in bright sunny day with direct sunlights on screen you can see the screen with ease Heart rate and sleep tracking     No accuracy in sleep and heart rate tracking     rates are wrong and when it comes to sleep tracking its pathetic my iphone tracks better sleep time than this Bluetooth range     Very less range in my home I have a coverage only when phone is in distance of     meter as soon as I move more than that connection is lost Its an average band if you want to buy it for work out you must use it as it has many workout modes and track the workouts properly  This should not be your daily driver when it comes to health tracking 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  It measures heart rate of pillows  bedsheet and air as well even if I wear it or not it measures heart rate while my all the settings are on mannual and it measures sleep while I was playing cricket worst fitness band ever
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Hi  I am not sure who to blame for this but I got a malfunctioning mi band the first time I ordered  So I ordered a return and replacement product  Only then I realized the original band looked very different and the first time I did not just get a malfunctioning product  IT WAS ACTUALLY A FAKE ONE  Amazon did fix the issue  but if the first product were charging  I would not even have bothered to find out if it was FAKE  Again  I do not know where it went wrong but this needs to be checked 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I had purchased it   days back  According to me it is a perfect smart band at a perfect price Its personalized face and battery service too good it consumes approx    battery per day if you left PAI Turned off also nicely controls camera notification calls  Overall a decent fitness band at this price  Mi you nailed it   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The band is too small to be able to read anything  What a waste of money  All bands in this category are basically useless since they are so tiny  that you can barely read anything  Would recommend ONLY if the user is okay with having an absolutely tiny screen 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Overall band is not so appealing as was expected Accuracy   step count algorithm should be better incase you drive via car wearing band it counts your steps  which should not be Battery life   I found it     days max  Which is again not compelling as per features rolled outOverall MI disappointed this time
Smartdevices,1,OR,  When i am purchasing this watch i felt it is very help full to my daily life but once i getting a  issue the mi service center and my solution technician saying there is no service for watch we can only replace it one second if there is have any broken is there they do not give service also because it is failure model of mi family they do not know how to fix the issues they know only one thing replace only  i am really sorry i can not expect this type of answers from mi very very bad service 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is my first smartwatch fitness band that I have ever worn and for    k  in its price range  is one of the best you can get undoubtedly Display is aesthetically pleasing  Crisp and lovely to look at  There are many watch faces apps on play store that let us you customize the display of the watch  it is satisfying to look at It has many options concerning activities both indoor and outdoor  The band makes it much easier in tracking your fitness to the greatest length Step counter is pretty accurate unlike the other reviews  I have counted my steps on many occasions from one point to another and looked at the watch just to find out it is the same number  The heart Bpm  well it seems to be on point as well as sudden spike in heart Bpm is shown like when you are walking a lil briskly or other activites Apart from that   weather  calories burned counter  notifications  sleep tracking  stress level meter and all of that seems to be working fine there is a lift sensor where the watch display gets turned on when you turn the watch towards you  it is great The watch vibrates when you are receiving a call but you can only decline the call  you can not answer it  You can skip next or previous to the music plus the volume control which I find easy while riding the bike or taking a walk Also completely waterproof but showering with it makes you look dumb lolThe charge stays on for a long time  full charge gives you a week The charger is magnetic and it is easy to plug in without much confusion Cons Could have been full display head to toe  but that is asking for too much and would have been lovelyThe feature to answer calls should have been includedThe mi fit app could be more refined and user friendly even though it is still great
Smartdevices,4,OR,  After using it for    days here is my review   Battery life   days max   Heart rate sensor  works well most of the time   So many customization options available in Mifit app and other feature like incoming call alter Cons   Battery life is   days  Xiomi should send OTA update to improve it  Its     of what Xiomi is claiming   No dark mode
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Overall I would say it is the best product which I got for        it is worthy I would totally recommend and it has amazing features
Smartdevices,4,OR,  writting the review after       month uses   Band is good  but its better to go for a smartwatch   the display is too short   sometimes it irritate me alot   mobile app after the update sucks    band display easily attract dust n scratch     tracking is fine    no prblm regarding the  functions    battery goes upto   to   days depends on your daily uses
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Has good build quality  reasonable brightness  has very good app view  MI devices has improved with the competition  has introduced multiple workouts and improved Heart rate sensors and other multiple options  Spo  option is missing which is available in honor  band 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Sleep and naps tracking is highly inaccurate  Sleep time range is wrong always and all sleep related data seems wrong like deep sleep  awake time etc  Also  Naps tracking rarely works during daytime  MI please fix these issues by software update 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it is been a while since I used fitness trackers  and mi  has exceeded my expectations that I decided to get one for my better half as well  Sleep monitoring is a welcome addition  and gives us insight into deep sleep  REM sleep  and light sleep  Pretty accurate if you ask me Ability to customize watch faces as much as you want make it a good choice  Accuracy is good  I would say     steps missed every     steps  But overall a good device in the price range
Smartdevices,5,CG,    Excellent for showoff   Good for exercise tracking   You can easily fool the step tracker by waving your hand   Heart rate monitor is     accurate as you compare it with oxy meter   Battery only last for   hrs so do not wear it if you want to go in a bear grylls like adventure 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Poor accuracy on number of steps and distance on walk mode  For same distance I found it be giving remarkably different readings  Not reliable for that purpose  However it can work as wrist watch and sync with phone to alert you for incoming call which is useful when mobile is inside purse  useful for ladies 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have always been skeptical about fitness bands n I still am as I think fitness bands are not that important but the pricing of this fitness band makes it a quite lucrative choice What I have liked so far    Fairly accurate step counting  I did counting in my mind while walking n then checked on band n the steps the band counted was most of the times accurate which is very impressive considering its price    A lot of workout modes    Menstrual cycle calculator  hence this band can be a very god choice for women as well    Battery life appears to be quite good too but will update after exhausting the current battery life 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Overall good  Feels a bit inaccurate in terms of heart rate monitoring Few points to clear    For some workouts like walking  cycling the band will not work unless you have phone with yourself for distance and location tracking  So if want to track that with only band in the morning  evening walk without phone  you can not do it    Battery does not last for   weeks  Its just when you keep heart and sleep monitor off    Ofcourse we will mostly keep heart rate and sleep monitor on always for better results and better tracking  due to which the battery lasts for     days only  from day one      to day          does not have unlimited watch faces exactly  It has limited watch faces  Other than that  its just that you can add any photo in background  from your gallery  but front section remains same  time  date  battery status  step count     Does not have heart rate widget on other watch faces 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Battery life is on an average of     days for moderate usage  SPo  functionality is not available  steps counting is accurate  heart rate sometimes does not count 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Intresting productPlus points  battery is very good  Accuracy is good it is having some memory to store data if it is not connected with phone   it can store multiple days data and later you can connect to phone than it will move all data from watch to phone    if you are going to use it just for watching time than definitely the battery will go for more than a month approximate     days  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I have been using a Mi Band   And Honor band   already  So this is like an upgrade for me  Here is my review based on first few days usage  Will update the review again after a months usage to include other things like battery backup            Pros             New AMOLED display is so beautiful and fairly bright for out door  New music controls  Volume  Track  Play pause  works really well  but with a small delay  Custom wallpapers is the best feature i found  at first sight the menus and UI looked like my old Band    But after setting custom wallpaper the whole band is in new level now    m waterproof just like Band    I have taken my Band   under all worst conditions and never observed even fogging  Hope Band   also acts rugged      day battery is a good figure  will test and update the review after sometime  Now you can easy turn on off alarm with band   it was not feature in band     Weather for current location changes as you move   shows location name as well on screen           More pros   Compared to MI Band    All for little more money               Larger AMOLED Display      in Band           in Band           Band     Can turn ON and OFF existing alarms directly from band Something i really wish i had on my Band     Tempered glass top  New sensors    axis accelerometer     axis gyroscope   Well  i am not sure what its for  Sharper and much brighter display  Larger battery      mAH Band          mAH  Band     Screen guards can be applied due to broader face  Charging time is less than Band    takes less than   hours           Cons             UI could have been better  on such a beautiful screen  the current themes look bad  Weather could have been added to home screen  Band   has it  Could have added a switch to turn on high brightness for outdoor usage  because if you set brightness to   full  always it is really bright for indoors  but ideal for outdoors   The step counter is too inaccurate  Like any other brands this band also counts too many false steps  By the time i reach office in my car it shows me     KM or more  but actual walk is less than     KM  So better forget this feature           Other Features             Lift hand to turn on display  Sleep monitor  Call and Message Notifications  MI App comes with lot of features compared to other brands  Find my device is very usefulWhether you should buy it  Yes  yes  yes  Go for it  Even if you are not a fitness freak  this band is quite useful for Call  SMS and Calendar notifications  Especially while driving  you do not need to pickup the phone to cancel or mute the call  And you can not ask for anything more for what you pay Other alternativesIf you are ready to she will out more  you can checkout Amazfit Bip or Amazfit Verge lite models And as usual  Amazon delivered my Band superfast  in two days 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I got this products not just a few days ago Seems like a complete waste of money   The workout modes do not sense the finger  Even tho you clean it   It hung screen freeze for hours yesterday Step counter is grossly inaccurate    By more then      steps   If you walk from ur bedroom to the loo uit counts     steps   The okay tick does not catch no matter how many times you press   Useless product does not have refund just a replacement hope that is not the same  Very disappointed 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I purchased it in October  it is amazingly working  I faced no issue till now  There are plenty of wallpapers which you can select according to your mood  I do not know how accurate the heart rate stress monitor is  but I realized I am turning a bit bad due to my laziness  But now I can keep track of everything and this can be a must add on to anyone s lifestyle  If you are looking for a good Fitbit then I would say you to go for this with a blind fold  I hoped for more features on this price mark but I feel it is worth buying 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros  It has a very good battery   Quick charging  Value for money  Nice watch faces but not too good  More activity tracking  Now it has magnetic charger which make it easy to charge than the previous model  Now it has stress monitor but not too accurate  It has new feature of breath control that will tell you how to breath properly for given time but it is not as usable Cons  if you use PAI than it will will reduce the battery life even reduce half   music and camera controls are not too nice it was just added to make it more advertisable else they are use less   the biggest problem with mi bands are their straps are one removed the it is very hard to put in proper position and in mi band   it become more hard as it has little bit hard strap   design is not good and people would not notice as it look little bit similar to mi band     the heart rate  step monitor and stress monitor are not accurate   it came at the same price of one plus fitness band but has not spo  tracker as well less less function This my review and opinion on this watch hope you will get a better glance to buy it or not If you are satisfied with my review let me know by Hitting the like Thank you
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The product is good and reliable at this price point It servers the purpose  the sleep tracking is fine it gives an overall clarity on individuals seepling patern  The mobile app works perftly  The accuracy i e  pedometer is not completely as per actuals but while waking once the same is activated it counts the steps properly  It very comfortable wearing the band  battery life is good the magnetic charging is best 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It is budget friendly premium gadget  I love this band   good product from Mi  Tracks    Sports Mode with good accuracy  tracks your steps   running  yoga  stress  PAI UI is also very easy  with an amoled display  and  ATM  water resistant for swimming tracking   one of the premium feature  No other company gives such a premium product in the price tag of Rs        even you can get a discount of Rs      with Amazon Pay Later payment mode  I would like to recommend this to all budget friendly people 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I bought the watch for running but it was a bad choice  The watch is highly inaccurate in distance calculation  Whereas my phone recorded a run of  kms  the watch had only recorded a distance of    kms  As I ran further  the difference between the distance calculated by my phone and my watch increased  The main reason the watch is so inaccurate in distance calculation is because it lacks a GPS  which one cannot expect in a smart watch at this price range although This apart  the heart rate calculation is good and reliable  The MI Fit app  which is to be downloaded on your phone  is a great app with space for customization of your watch  There are also third party apps on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store which can give you a whole lot of other options to customize and use this watch to its maximum potential  such as having Google Maps  technically  run on the watch I am not happy about the inaccuracy of the watch but at this price range  when I can even use the watch to take a photo from my phone s camera and answer calls  there is not much else to complain about 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Batterybackup is not as expected    I hardly get around   days with full charge and that too turning off all the functions  And even when the battery percentage drops to     it rapidly drains after that  Maybe within    minutes it shuts down  And this issue is there from day one 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Reviewing the product after a month  The battery lasts for atleast   weeks  But if I try to switch on Regular heartbeat monitoring  PAI  or sleep assistant mode it warns me about reduced battery life  The app warns onCharging is super quick  the length of the charger wire is small so suitable to charge with laptop I have not given full stars on accuracy as the band adds up step count when my arms move rapidly in any activity  Upon syncing  my iPhone health app however does not take the bands step count on face value so satisfied with the products use  I found the sleep tracking to be quite up to the mark  Gives details of light and deep sleep modes The yoga workout mode is not accurate at all  Unless I pause it  the band seems to keep calculating calories lost based on time This might not be common to all user but I have an itching sensation if the band is slightly tight for a long duration  as is needed for workout modes or measuring heart rates 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Pros Battery life   I get a battery life of    days with all features at it is maximum  continuous heart rate tracking  sleep tracking always on Display is crisp and clearThe default themes are good enough for me and they also save battery as they are BlackCharging mechanism has been made so much better and easier  I do not think it is stressed enough in other reviews  Saves the strap from a load of wear and tearSteps tracking is up there with the best like apple watch  you can watch YouTube videos Sleep tracking is pretty good  Once a while it might show something off but mostly it is accurate Easy pairing with device and no unwanted disconnections it is priced very well Cons Notification customisation on iOS devices is not that great Find my phone feature does not work on iOSI personally do not mind the above   cons and hence the   star rating  Otherwise it would have been a  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The first product I received was faulty but after replacing it  the perfoence is fine  After   days of use I can say that the accuracy of the trackings are quite accurte  But the stress monitor oi pai  I do not find any good result  Overall its a good quality band but from budgetperspective its quite same as the band    Only diff  is magnetic charger 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  For some reason  the device does not track sleep activity before midnight  If I sleep from    pm to   am  the device only recognizes sleep activity from midnight to   am     pm to midnight does not register  Therefore  one of the main purposes behind my purchasing the device has been thwarted  Disappointed 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am actually downgrading myself from Gear S  to this one  Except for the size and style  everything else works great  except HR   Sleep and sedentary tracking actually works great  I love it  And the wrist band is an added convenience when compared to S   You can wear this       Only major con for me is that It does tend to show heart rate even when it is not worn  Slightly lesser inconvenience could be the app s interface  When compared with Samsung its not so user friendly   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have used this Band for almost   months now  here is my review  Pro s      Display  It has      colorful Amoled touchscreen display  bright enough for outdoors and sunny days    Battery Life and charging  The battery life lasted me       days on single charge  I was not using sleep tracking but Automatic heart rate reading was on  A full charge from   took only an hour  it comes with magnetic proprietary charge cable  Note  I have used   watt fast charger    Supported Apps  Watchfaces  The One thing that may stand out for this band is that it can be used with other applications such as Google Fit  Notify for Mi Band etc  There are many Watchfaces in the app and you can create your own too  but there are only few that I liked and the customisation is limited  but as it supports  rd party Watchfaces it would be useful    The Build Quality  For the price the build is okay  it is entirely made up of plastic  polycarbonate material flexible plastic     Waterproof  The watch is waterproof upto   m    Bands  Outershell   The bands are replaceable and available Cons    Accuracy  The accuracy was hit and miss for me  the heart rate was usually        off  Even Sleep Tracking was not that accurate only measures the basic information not the deep data  Same goes with step count    The Mi Fit App  I do not like the Mi Fit app  the design layout does not impressed me at all  it is not mature like other Mi apps    The Fitness Data  The fitness data is not super helpful as it is not that detailed in the Mi Fit App  If you are buying it for only fitness purpose only go with Honor Band      The build quality is okay  but it feels a little thick from sides    Still not enough good Watchfaces available right now    The Stress Monitoring feature worked only   out of    times Conclusion  I am neither impressed nor disliking it but I feel if a person buying a fitness band it should have deep fitness data which this band lacks offering  So go with Honor Band    which is more smoother in operating and     bucks cheaper than this 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using it since last    days with medium to heavy usage  and still the battery is around     with a single charge  So good battery life   And sleep monitoring also works  well  The band is also feels free on hand  The activity tracker is fine  Smooth Amoled touch  heart monitoring and stress monitor works well  Weather info needs synchronization by conneting with the app again and again Apart from that remote capture music control notification access and call monitoring are other features Also there is a lot in activity tracking ranging from outdoor to indoor activites Band material is kind of good  as does not feel sweaty while continous wearing for long hours too Magnetic and hasslefree charging is another edge over other bands within the same range 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Highly inaccurate steps tracking  it is based on hand movement and not steps  I walked everywhere without moving my hand and still the steps were zero  And lying on bed I rapidly moved my hand so it counted steps  I mean MI band   was more accurate than this piece of crap
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Sleep tracking is not that great as at time when I do not wear and sleep it still shows data so you can not really trust it is accuracy and stuff also if you want acurate sleep data then a lot of battery  is drained which is iritating and in long run not good for band and also from my personal experience I can say that wearing it and sleeping is very uncomfortableMobile  App is great     Actually the best in this rangeRest it is great when you are active awake great stuffValue for money 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I like the accuracy  initially I thought the readings are wrong like the heart rate or stressBut when it gives you the average daily or weekly data then you realize the accuracyAlso the battery is very long lifeI guess it is been more than    days I have not recharged it for the second timeI just hope it continues to perform wellOf course that app download was fussy  but when got a clear understanding and hold now I can control and take maximum out of the Mi band
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Pic     Outdoor cycling   The path shown in the image is actually the opposite to the direction in  which I performed the activity  Distance shown is lesser than actual distance covered  Even more  it actually started tracking distance after I would already covered    kms   I already synced with Mi Fit App  Switched my GPS on  and locked the application  Pic     After waking up  going to cycling directly and coming back  it should have been maximum     steps  But it shows       Also  just after waking up it shows some      steps   lol I am really disappointed with the product  even though it as some good pros like  amazing battery life  after like     days it is on     charge   sleep tracking  the only thing which is nearly accurate   good touch sensitivity and display  mi fit app is OK  water resistanceOther cons    inaccurate heart rate  inaccurate stress monitoringThe main selling point of any  smart  band watch is the fitness features it provides  I do not want a good battery life or screen but provide me accurate informations  Inaccurate gps tracking  calorie tracking  steps tracking  heart rate tracking is enough for me to give it     
Smartdevices,3,OR,  it shows wrong data most of the time   During workouts when you use free training  It shows the wrong heartbeat sometimes  while you actually can feel that the heartbeat is more than that   same thing with outdoor running  it shows wrong data    Heart rate tracking is way off Sleep tracking is not so good   sometimes you are lying around and it shows you are sleeping   Battery life is good  I have kept everything on like auto detect    hr heart rate  and sleep monitoring  and all it gives me around   to    days battery life I think if you are a runner you should get it    But I would say get a better one  it is just a mediocre thing    Spend a little more and get a better one    Also no spo  monitor also    it is a gimmicky watch    Still can not understand why pai goes low every day and does not track that either properly    Every day I workout around    to   hrs high intensity and I feel it does not track properly     can not wear it during combat training like boxing  martial arts  etc    So not worth that    If you want to see only calorie burns during a workout there is a  separate band for that  go for that     I have been using more than a month    Not worth it  save money get a better one   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  A perfect smart watch with all the features you need  it is just slightly bigger than the preceders  you will not even figure it out unless kept next to each other and fits perfectly on your wrist without looking odd or big 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I am really happy with the product and its features You can wear it and not have to worry about opening an app for counting steps  running time  etc  Battery life and charging time is good too  even with PAI detector constantly on Would have given it   starts if the body had not broken so easily  I have not used for even a month and it broke without any rugged use  I was not expecting and very displeased with this quality of the hardware Everything else is great P s  the order came with a black strap  The pick one in the picture was bought separately 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  First of all I am glad that I could made it on  st Oct in the lightning deal  The package was delivered in   days to me  The Mi Band   is loaded with all new features and had great battery life The features I liked the most are   Amoled Display   Accuracy  which needed to be improved further    Water resistant   PAI   New Modes   Lightweight   Improved Heart Sensor   Personalisation with Notify AppCons     The Packaging was poor   can not be turn off   Sometimes it auto senses the heart rate even if you are not wearing the band   Pedometer accuracy to be improved further I had deducted a star due to Amazon s poor delivery and when I unboxed the band it was fully discharged  May be because of packaging of amazon which has tempered the box when it delivered to me Although after using it I was satisfied  do not think go ahead for purchase because it is value for money product 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I been using Band   and   and it was another upgrade Serves good so far  Brightness is great for day light  battery life much better than its honor competition  Monthly cycle for females is a software edition but serves the purpose well Wish it had SPO  sensor as well
Smartdevices,1,OR,     Step counting displays double the actual number of steps one has taken   Even when one has removed the band  the heart rate sensor continues to show    bpm heart rate    do not trust reviews on Amazon  Looks like the manufacturer has paid their way to a   star rating  I trusted them and wasted my money 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   it is simple easy to use and tracks almost everything as described  But in my personal opinion the cost should not more than  K for this  But very effective  Sleep tracking is fine  MiFit app works better   And pretty accurate in my case 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Was sent a used MI band   packed in MI band   box which was really surprising but the return and replacement process was smooth The replacement was nice and happy with the product  Screen quality and features sets are excellent  Battery life is good even with heavy usage  MI app needs a little time getting used to  The band is pretty comfortable to wear all day long
Smartdevices,4,OR,  good product at this price rangeCharging last for     daysSleep tracking z goodHeart rate monitor also working fineBut when comes to step counting not soo accurateRest all fine
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I slept say   pm to    pm and it records only   pm to   pm  Most day time sleep gets cut off as short naps of maximum   to   hrs  The whole purpose to buy this watch was defeated for me as I own AmazeFitBip already  do not understand y the sleep tracking needs to force a person to sleep at night
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The incoming calls notification does not always work  it is bothersome while traveling  do not know whether it is application issue or the band s  Please do fix it    FYI I have checked all the possible setting and configuration to rule out problem from my side 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  All the important features have been covered earlier  so I will point out my observations after a month s usage    The sleep tracker is pretty decent and does the job well    The step counter is not that accurate and paired with the workout modes on the Mi app  seems to underestimate the steps taken by me on runs jogs  I have cross checked with another fitness band as well as   other apps    It has a great battery life as promised and can comfortably last       days depending on the number of features enabled on the watch   The heart rate monitor may have some error margin so do not expect perfect results  An expensive fitness tracker will give you more accurate readings  but at this price you cannot complaint much about it Overall  a recommended buy 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The band is really good  Fits really well and never felt discomfort wearing it for long time  It tracks the sleep well  but cannot say the same regarding heart rate and calories  The heart rate monitor is set to be active all the time  but it shows very inaccurate sometimes  To get accurate heart rate i need to manually check it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This is my first smartwatch so nothing to compare against  But still it is very useful in tracking steps and calorie burnt accurately  Sleep tracker is okay and mostly correct but sometimes it might show you re asleep if you have been watching some late night show without much movement 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Loving the product  major upgrade    As you can see my PAI level its      let me say this is the most accurate step tracking and heart rate even the sleep monitoring tbh do not know about the sleep tracking but best for steps and outdoor activities was using apple watch series   and now mi band   tbh loving it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am an iPhone user from last   years and I have not used any android devices  I wanted to try mi band so I choose mi   My review after using for   weeks Sleep tracking  Brilliant tracking by using heart beat and blood flow  Manages to show deep sleep and Normal sleep Mobile app  I only have few features because I use iOS  Still better Workout  I brought mi only to track my workout progress  It has various features such as walking  running  treadmill etc  It has more accuracy rate than any other bands  But they have to work more in freestyle workout  It shows how many calories are burnt and breathing rate Notifications  very simple yet so convenient  But should have an option to lift the call and very good if we can reply with custom messages Nice censors  But no speakers in watch  Should be good if it rings or having a sound notification feature will add some good engagement value Also you have to connect with your Bluetooth all the time  And the distance will be not more than   m  If mi somehow manages to connect through online or increase the distance to connection  it will be betterMy overall rating      My suggestion  good buy I bought it for      on nov         Hope this help   
Smartdevices,5,OR,     out of    MI band   is better than I imagined as my first Smart  watch  device   I can only say I am not living without one anymore   It helps you a lot by giving some important feedback   That one would assume is not possible to     with such a small equipment   For example  the sleep analysis available is mind blowing the bandwidth   it is absurd that I was sleeping badly even though I still have enough hours a day  around   hours     I have begin to change some of these activities to help fix it and I can feel the difference already feeling less sleepy during daytime heart rate increases base sleep analysis app notification   You can select which once you receive from   You can even connected with Google fit to count your works to other app like Pokemon go not to mention the battery life of this thing   It is as a box says I am using with a lot of better consuming features on and Still last for more than two weeks   I feel like all those people praising Xiaomi right if there is anything like this smart band  I am recommending this for my friends and family worth your money so far  Not enough to not give   stars 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Pros   Brightness is good even outdoor you can see clearly    Battery life is good  After      charged used for   hrs but still showing         Like the feature of Lock screen for band display    No latency to control music on band    Light weight Cons   although no as such  may be for someone    Mi should reduce bezel size    Band strip is not aligned to capsule    Events should be created on band itself  we have to use app to create    No badminton mode    I was unable to change date format as it showing MM DD  But I like it to be DD MM 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  its counts when we ride bike also After using for    days my observationis  its sleep tracker shows all wrong information  its waste product with all wrong info   if you are looking for smart watch do not buy this Changed rating from   star to   star after    days usage 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst accuracy in step count and cycling  distance  so far For a distance of over   km cycling  band    recorded hardly anything  Have no proof regarding step count but I can say it is over calculating my movements as actual steps No refunds Only replacement 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I purchased on first sell  This band is really improved compared to band   After someday of usage I found that day sleep is calculating wrong  I raised this issue multiple time  even sent mail  went service center but still same  No one is fixing this Service center do not know how to fix So guy s check this issue within   days else you can replace from seller if any issues is there 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not but this smart band or should I say just a piece of rubber with a screen on it it is not at all accurate reached       steps just by sitting on my couch heart rate is    while I am working out and     while I am relaxed are you serious Conclusion   if you are buying this just for its looks then go for it but do not even consider if you are into any kind of sports or want activity tracking 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This product is overall okay and nothing more than this so its not a dramatically good in this price point  I think MI had to do some more work on accuracy point of view because that part of band is more essential than other  these is the MI fifth version of band  but accuracy like this is not too valuable for buyers its also lacks spo  feature in      that is also a part that MI had to done some work 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Best among all fitnesses bandJust for mi band without any doubt Light weight  touch feel is good  water proof Good sensor   flexibleI will recommendNo negative points hence i am give   star
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Fine in the beginning  battery backup of    days with heavy usage and accuracy is above     which is not a big deal for me Then issues started popping up after one and half month  Mi Fit will not sync workouts sometimes  heart monitor is brokeHeart Rate will not go above     bpm during High Intense workout which I usually get above     bpm and this in turn makes low calories count  MAKES ME UNMOTIVATED  Heart rate would go above    bpm when I am relaxed and watching a movie  And this is messing with my PAI score  Tried all kinds of troubleshooting like resetting band  updating firmware  drained battery and tested again  Looks like heart monitor sensor itself is broke  I even looked in reddit for solution  and I am not the only one facing this issue  there were like hundreds of them facing this issue 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  After   days of usage all I can say is it is value for money band  Here are the reasons    Sleep assistant is really awsome  It accurately calculates naps and sleep  Its accuracy is almost        Its timer  alarm  watchfaces  display  battery backup is really great So I am totally satisfied with this watch and its quality  I will highly recommend this watch 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought too early now the cost is less  sleep tracking is awsm   helpful to me   nap tracking is working awsm  spo  is not there well it is not a big issue  as there is no inbuilt gps steps counting is not that accurate  most awsm thing is music control   camera action I am loving it   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Superb Quality product    Very good features    Worth purchasing for       less     instant discount  this price   Seems there is a small dead inactive pixel on the screen visible only on the lock screen    so going to replace it    Apart from that Mi Band qualities are always superb
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I do not know but its accuracy is very less as compared to honor band   or mi band    Sleep tracking is average while steps counter is too poor   When i walk only     steps   it counts       I do not know what is the problem 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I had been using for about two weeks here is the discription    Sleep tracking information in the app is not  that much as honar band   but it does the job    Spo  is not there   The passcode lock feature in mi band   is not there in     there are about    watch faces  but still we can use  rd party apps      hrs heart rate monitor is accurate and I love it    We can even moniter our stress when we are relaxed automatically    The battery backup is also good    days but if you use   hrs heart rate monitoring and   hrs stress monitor is on it might run of quickly but still good 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  After a week long use  battery is consistent as advertised  Tracking on other hand is a situation one of its kind  Sleep tracking is colorful if not anything else  Be prepared for deep imprints of watch on your skin  especially that  cm from wrist necessity is going to tighten things literally 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Not that much of a great product  I do not think it is very accurate  may be nearly    to     If we wear the item and just lifting hands and taking back  It account to be   stepAnyways it is an okay okay item  Pretty good   Overall a nice and useful one 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The band look is very premium the band looks r very funky and the    modes given work perfectly  The band has a very beautiful display and the app mifit gives you easy access to everything I would say the band is very user friendly   I was confused in buying this or honor band   see both have their pro s and con s you can go for this band if you want a better screen and best looks and in it we can change band straps  it is not so accurate for heart rate  If you want more of a fitness band you must go for honor band   but if you e okay if the heart rate and sleep tracking is    percent accurate then I would suggest you to go this band but if you are more of a fitness freak you must go for honor band  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It has been   days of usage and the battery is still at     on a single full charge  Well  the first couple of days it took me time to understand the usage pattern so it drained a lot of charge from it  I think I can use a couple of days more before i need to plugin to charge  Well the battery life is excellent  Xiaomi could have given the same or larger battery than Band    In this case they reduced it  We could have got a better battery life Well  navigating through the band interface is seamless  Quite smooth but will not say it to be the smoothest  Amoled display looks awesome  Other functionalities are good  Coming to the workout detection and accuracy  the band works good on detecting basics like walking  running  cycling but I felt the band is not perfectly accurate while working out  Accuracy can always be improved by the company if the market demands  More efficient watch faces required  Hope some OTA upgrades will resolve such issues  Otherwise the band is worth it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  A good daily use band accurate step monitoring   big and bright display   stress monitor      workout mode   innovative strap material which holds firmly even after pin is unlockedCons    battery backup is less compared to previous version
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I used this product to track my sleep as well as to monitor my workout  Although it is not always accurate  the watch is really good  It is very easy to use  What I did dislike however is the mobile app  it can be made better  One time  whilst charging  the watch did vibrate a lot out of nowhere  It kept vibrating so I had to factory reset  The reason is still unknown to me but the other functions were not damaged and more importantly the battery life is still intact  One major update I would want is to update the watch functions to multitask  By that  I mean when I go out for a job  changing music while in the background it is still tracking my calorie burner and step counter  I do not want to lose my tracking because I wanted to change one song 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Good for mobile notifications and connectivity and overall  but for heartrate one can never rely on these products as they are not fool proof and at times not consistent  also it is expensive then honor band It should have offered a little more for Rs      
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought this watch to track my steps and calories burnt  I think it does a great job  I cannot check the calories burnt while doing cardio and strength training but I did not buy it to check that  The battery life is incredible  I mean  I got this delivered on   th oct and put it to charge today  that is  th November     days of battery life is amazing  I wore it all the time  I tracked sleep for a few days and did not after that since I do not want to depend on devices too much  I was shocked to see how less I sleep  I also used stopwatch while exercising  While running I checked my heart rate too  It starts vibrating if your heart rate is too high  that is good If your requirement is like mine  you should definitely go for it  Hope this helped    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This  review is made after usage of a week  MI BAND   is a great band in budget  This band gives accurate reading of many modes like sleep tracking several workout modes  heart rate counter  stress measuring etc  It  also has a great PAI feature which gives you an overall score of your fitness  Its MIFIT APP also has tons of features  Its AMOLED screen is also great  Its magnetic charger is also a fantastic way of charging as we do not have to remove band from strap every time to charge But its sleep tracking feature shows sometimes inaccurate data and On its back  an outward bump in which the sensors for heart rate counting is there which gives a little bit uncomfortable feeling when band is weared for a long time  But these are not big problems At last  i want to say that this is a great band worth buying under       Go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Using it for last one week  really awesome and best health monitor  Sleep monitor is nearly accurate  Heart beat rate and stress monitor not sure how it works  There is a difference in oxygen meter reading and band reading for heartbeat rate  Over all good band at this cost 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I bought this after checking too much checking the reviews in Youtube  GSM  Amazon  Many will say One plus  please do not go  bit small and light but MI will be look good and awesome  i checked in showroom Most them do not say this  Only MI band   can pair with Iphone not One plus or other leading brands  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The band is good in tracking various exercises  The exercises are limited but will work if you are a casually into working out  The sleep data is a bit off track and not very reliable although it tracks sleep duration accurately The mobile app is simple to use and should be used to track the work outs while connected to the band The battery life is       days based on usage  If you keep it always connected via bluetooth and higher brightness then it will come down to     days All in all it is a great budget tracker and band  it is a great value for money 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I had purchased it on first sale the accuracy of this product is something that disappointed me the steps are been calculated while I was riding my bike and the heart rate accuracy when I check manual it is fine but the automatic heart rate tracking is completely inaccurate while workout MI needs to fix this as soon as possible via update Battery life is ok gives one week with all the options enabled
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Simply loved it  First of all I got it in one day thanks to Amazon Previously I was using mi band  The amoled  display  of this band is silky smooth with vibrant colours   details So many customisations available in mobile app Magnetic chargic dock is an icing on cake Simply loved it   
Smartdevices,2,OR,  First I said that main function of a smartband is accuracy  step count is not accurate  but I am ok as in this price range it is ok but first time I face some problems in hear rate and stress monitoring and after replacement  nd time no workout is tracking after connect with Bluetooth and also gps   and when I start any workout it automatically stops and no tracking is found in the band like kilometres  speed etc 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Ya   It has every feature you need in a fitness band  and it is still the best fitness band you could buy now  But  I still give this a   star cuz I have expected mi to increase battery capacity but they deceased   mah  it is still not a high step back but for a really small fitness tracker battery capacity matters  I also used mi band   and yea  I think it is not a worthy upgrade  Ifvyou have mi band   unless if you need more fitness tracking go to mi band    It has more fitness tracking than mi band    If you need a band to show notifications and few smart features  go with mi band    Even mi band   gives you similar features except for few fitness options  My final answer is it is not a huge upgrade at all  do not buy mi band   if you already have mi band    Save money for mi band   or something  Comparing it with it is past versions shows a slight improvement 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  The band tracks the heart rate even when the band has been removed  A good band to check the amount of steps taken in a day  Heart rate not accurate  Rest of features good for the budget  do not expect accuracy from the band 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good for steps number  battery keeps up for      days when fully charged  water splash resistant  yes   heart beat measurements little off track  but good for people who wants to keep track of their daily activity   Not for people with cardiac ailments  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Size little smaller but fully functional  Some bugs come like when you move only hand walking counting  And when you walking and your hand was not movement then not counting  Battery drain fast when all functions apply  Overall buy if you want smaller watch 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   After using it for almost   months  i can explain what to expect Step tracking is accurate       while i counted it during my walk it looked      accurate Sleep tracking is missing  i can not sleep while wearing this as i do not want to get bothered Overall  its an amazing product and track every thing from swimming to calorie burn after selecting the desired mode 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Worth every penny spent on this gadget    to     accuracy on all aspects  Looks premium on hand Idle alerts works accurately Sleep tracking does his job perfectly Mobile app notification will lag if your device charge is less than     Workout time censors is at par Once charged easily lasts for    to    days Overall very satisfied with the performance for the price 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The band is great  with so many more features than Mi band    which I have used as well  The only issue I am facing is the watch being too bulky to wear while sleeping  I remove it before bed  hence sleep tracking feature is not useful for me  Mi   band although only slightly smaller than this  was still wearable while sleeping Otherwise it is a great product overall and best at its price range 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  quality awesome after sometime we do not even feel like there is a band in our handsanimated wallpapers you can get as much as from mi band   watch faces appperfect band for workoutand band is      water proof can go through shower with it and can go for a swimapart from mi band   this thing is supercoolcolorfull and latest technologieslove xiaomi
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This band is best in the market  This band can also track the naps Sleep tracking          Display under sunlight      Activities tracker         Battery          Watch faces        But you can use  rd party apps to use more watch faces and I also recommend you to use other apps Features      
Smartdevices,3,OR,  It is good in terms of working  measuring accuracy etc  But the issue I feel is with the display size  The font are very small  I use amazefit band and using this after bigger display is pain  May be people who are using this as their first watch get adjusted 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Guys I highly recommend you to check this   Look into the band in sunlight  let me know if you see a blue tint of light emitting below the single touch button   do not know whether it is for me Or by design     
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Is a decent product but quite inaccurate with steps and workout   Shows I have walked steps despite being on the bed sleepingIt counts steps while driving or riding   wheeler which is highly inaccurate and messed up The band alone is bogus with the distance calculator despite it having my height and weight    Sure it can be a bit inaccurate but more than    m in a  km walk is seriously messed up I have not been able to get battery life beyond   days on normal mode    WeirdIt did not capture my naps once but otherwise it is quite accurate for sleep analysisReview date         
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros is known by most of you so I will focus on the cons    Sleep tracking is inaccurate  way less accurate than in comparison to honor band      Automatic activity detection are not working well  Hit or miss    Stress monitoring is inconsistent  Yea one of the least touted feature of this band PAI seems quite prominent to me as it pushes you to reach your goals And the worst cons mentioned by others is lack of SpO   like seriously most of the SpO  measurement especially on wrist is inaccurate to be even taken consideration of  so why to bother about that 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am using this product from  st Oct       Basically  i use this product for only sleep tracking  walking  freestyle workout  skipping  Footsteps accuracy is not       Sleep tracking  Walking and skipping are very good features which is useful to me  Battery usage is very good  i use to charge it only once in a week  Stress level measuring is not that accurate Good    Sleep tracking    Walking    Jumping rope Average    Footsteps accuracy    Stress level accuracyOverall a very good product for my usage at this price 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Purchased it with a discount of     and see what received a used product where    the packaging has already unlocked and covered with normal cellotapes   The band has uncountable scratches  probably used product more than a month Display is okay but boundaries of display is not that much satisfying like used   I am not even going to try this product and not even going to buy anything from sale  This is the main reason why I like to shop with Flipkart  sad  but the product was not available there 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Extremely lightLooks decentGreat battery lifePretty low charging timeStep tracker is not very accurateWe could have used some more functions in the deviceBut overall  pretty good for its price range
Smartdevices,2,OR,  It gives wrong counting of steps  if you are not walking and moving your hands on chairs it count them as steps Sleep tracking works fine Data syncing with app is worst feature you will see  it does not tell speed while cycling or will tell you wrong results like having avg speed more than max speed also it gets paused even if  you are running and cycling so it irritates me everytime i have to resume it Battery very good   almost used it for    days witbout charge having daily morning and evening exercise routine Display is nice and smooth 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Very poor strapping pin type method  Already lost this watch in just    days after purchase while trekking as the pin type grip came out easily  Better buy honor band  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very fast delivery  got it on the next day I have ordered it I have been using it for   days now n I will say that sleep tracking is very accurate n heart tracking is fine but steps count is not at all accurate  But seeing the price you can not expect much from it And the battery was charged       in   hours n its been two days n i have been using all the features of this watch n its at       you could go for me band   for better battery lyf but it has more features than me band   But all other things are just up to the mark you will never regret buying this product just go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Writing this review after using it for one week   Battery after   days of usage       Automatic heart rate monitoring turned on    Sleep detection  heart rate monitoring  steps are pretty accurate   Charging takes around   hour   Touch response is very good   Notification feature works well  found it very useful No cons as of now It is an amazing device  just go for it without a second thought 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using this watch from past   months  This watch helps me in pushing myself more  The best thing about this product is it gives you plenty of options to track your workout and also it helps you in tracking your period cycles  It has couple of more options which earlier watch did not have  So overall it is worth buying 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I liked the battery life and it is awesome magnetic charger  it is screen is also very good with so many watch faces  But i am not satisfied in sleep tracking  bcoz when i sleep   hours  it shows only   or   hours and it is worst  So for sleep tracking it is not a good product  Otherwise it is OK
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Review after a   month usage  Really liked the product  Thanks amazon for fast delivery Pros Found Accurate tracking of steps workout and bpm Comfortable band and magnetic charger is a relief Notification Alert and fast and long distance connection to phone is impressive ConsSleep monitoring need to improve     user need to take care of skin rashes  like applying oil  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Super love the strap  I was so worried that it will not fit me since I have a tiny wrist  Thanks its proper and it does not look like bulky to my wrist  Its a good band if you want to track every movement of yours and esp if I am doing something I can simply get a notification over my band  Its worth it  Not that pricey yet useful helpful 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  There is no accuracy whatsoever  If you are looking for a tracker with good accuracy sensors  the Mi Smart Band   is abysmal  The sensors are inaccurate 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Expected a better performance Built and make of the product is really good  And packaging was really good With respect to battery back up it meets the claim if you are not a heavy user Experience wise its up to the expectations I mean just friendly  But when it comes to accuracy its lagga bit  There are lot of room for improvements but for the price its really worth going for it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Cons  This band do not show seconds with time  but shows in timer or stopwatch It does not beep because it has not any speaker Pros  on schedules  events  notifications and alarms it vibrates nicely We can schedule our daily routine for days and weeks it is very useful for students who want a reminder for all day study It has stopwatch and timer also it is comfortable Quality is nice Charges fast and gives long battery backup around    days Magnetic charging system is very nice If you add your daily routine in this band you will be very happy with this band Nice band overallHeart rate monitor  stress  breathing like options are useless and do not matter for most of the people 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Decent sleep tracking but bad quality of strap   Damaged my skin in one week  can not wear it all day 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I reviewes    th day after i received this mi band    I will tell clear feedback about this ban   The dispaly is simply superb    In the outside also its visible clearly    And the tracking system is better than all other bands availble in the market  Its very accurate  Its have outside running  walking sleeping  rop jumping  swimming etc    And heartbeat tracking also very accurate    Mi fit app is also good   once charged band fully we will used it upto       days   The charhing faciliy is good   Overall product is good go for it  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  did not expect this from MI Band     Totally disappointed            Inaccurate steps tracking  it is based on hand movement  Step count is basic thing any fitness band must do   It is not tracking day time sleep  Inaccurate heart count and stress Totally worthless for money paid  Even Replaced the product but still Inaccurate 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Device get discount atleast once day n sleep tracker is not at all accurate   added around     steps while i was sleeping  Not value for money
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Looks beautiful with a crisp OLED display and it is bigger than the previous iteration And the best part is the charging mechanism  just bring it close to the contact points and click it attaches itself Lots of customisationLots of functionsResponsive touchVery bright and easily visible under direct sunlight
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Am adding my review after    days usage   I thing this band is best only for watch face  heart rate and night sleep workout map I have used walking workout  features   it is working as per expectations For step count it is working totally fail  If your traveling somewhere band calculating steps Or just stand   at one place and just do a left right left experience  band counting steps it is impacting your Target active  goal feature Band strap is not bad it fitted well but some time it get unlock automatically In positive cenerio steps count features work perfectly 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Great product    It works well and screen touch response is also great   All the modes worked well  however there is scope for improvement in its precision  Looks good Battery life is also good  Overall I will rate     for this product  Great smart fitness watch 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I bought this mainly for sleep tracking but it has not been very useful  The MI app takes charge of your smartphone in a typical Chinese way leaving you no room to make your own choices  There are far better brands around for the price 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent band  Though this is my first fitness band  absolutely in love with the features  The tracking is pretty accurate and a real motivator to not sit idle  Been using it everyday since past   days and battery charge is still at    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using this since more than a month and I am very much satisfied with this product  you can see all your phone s notifications on this band and can track your Exercises too  it is waterproof and I have been washing this band daily under running water  you can also watch my video regarding this band on my Youtube Channel  Stallion ATV  
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Battery drains fast  causes skin irritation and redness Recognizes activity  walking  running  etc  after a long period   usually after I have walked   km it asks if I am walking to register workout  or else you can also do that manually but it is too tedious and to drains battery in one day only if you want to track all physical activity  But for this price  it is okay if there are these drawbacks 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Mi band   has so many watch faces  With mi band app   the calls and sms notifications are very accurate  It has a magnetic charging point  So its easy to charge the band  The display has changed little bit  It is mainly a fitness band  But i bought it for receiving map notifications while riding but with the third party application it is very slow and its not accurate enough  Other than that it is good Thanks amazon  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very nice product  I generally avoid purchasing Chinese products but this one is I think on of the best product in this price range  Battery life best in class  Sleep Tracking  heart rate monitoring  work out monitoring are some of the satisfying   differentiating factors  Display is too good   light weight   you will not even realize when you wear it  Totally loved the product 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I am giving review after    days Battery life is good with heavy use   when    hr HR is on    pai is in    to   days With light use it is gives upto       days Sleep tracking is not accurate Stress monitoring is working well      accurate during activy Overall good product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it is a great band which I got       and even I have received a charger which is really long around    CM but it not      accurate in sleep tracking and sometimes it is lagging In auto detect workout and the battery uses around     daily with    hrs heart rate monitor and heavy usage so overall with a full charge it is easy to use for   days bt over all its worth under    k
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is a good fitness tracker for beginners    slight improvement from mi band      screen is bright    good batter life    many welcome new fitness activity tracking modes   stress measuring mode     breathing mode   weather app    PAI also included
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Really worth for the money Sleep tracking   checkStep count   checkCycles   checkWorkout   checkHeart rate   checkNotifications   checkLooks   very goodRemember  you can only reject or silence calls but can not answer them Also  you cannot connect bluetooth earphones directly to the band  You have to connect it to your phone but can control from the band 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Step counting in this is bogus af    Notification   all is pretty good   But step count is worst   It always shows alot more   
Smartdevices,5,CG,     NIce sleep  stress  excersize tracking  Nice heart rate monitoring  Can control music  reject calls  see notifications  Can set vibrating alarms  Can set custom images as clock background  No irritation after months of usage  Perfectly waterproof  can swim bathe wearing it  Battery not as expected even after optimizing the functions
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I use mi band   and   and bought   it is good but the app sucks and lagsProsNice features like customising the home page of bandBattery lasts   weeksConsHeart rate monitoring can be improved as a slight movement also shows not measured which never happens in   or   bandThe screen can be big
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Mi band   is surprisingly very good  Very good in tracking your heart rate and day today activity  If you have budget of Rs        just go for it  You will not regrets Very sturdy and light weight you can wear it all day and night without any discomfort   Awesome
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Having this watch for a while now   i would say it is the best investment it actually forces you to get fit  The heartbeat tracking is accurate  I love the step counter  and most important the interface is so smooth  you will not feel it lagging even a bit  I really like all the feature  looking forward to buy more for friends and family  I would     percent recommend this 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Everything  else is okay but tracking of workouts like cycling  running  is pathetic  If start a cycling workout   it pauses by itself every   seconds   no accidental touches ensured I took a workout of my cycling from Mi fit app and it was also buggy  Was showing a km coverage in    seconds or less
Smartdevices,5,CG,  For the price  it is the best experience  The tracking is pretty accurate especially during workouts  It also tracks my naps  Go for it  Its pretty nifty on the wrist too  so that you can wear a watch on the same wrist without much hassle  You can not do that with a bigger square screen 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Only screen is big and app is working fine  Battery life is just one week  I guess Band   was anytime better in battery life  Nothing so great    star for timely delivery and magnetic charging  do not have to remove the strips for charging
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice product and degine go for itSatisfied by degine and battery backupStape acuarecy      Step count at the time of bike and car ridingProblem with wrist view information display is blink at time of bike riding if you are anable wrist view information Product is nice go for it without any doubtAwaiting for update solve short band issueThanks Amazon for fast deliveryUnlimited watche faces
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Absolutely stunning    Love the band very much Not      accurate            but still I love the band with amoled display The band got stress level monitor PAI  activity tracking  sleep tracking and  many other features from its predecessors Want a great band with reasonable price just go for it I have changed the straps with red colour straps that also looks great 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Band build quality is good and good bright colour   Sleep tracking is accurate and give good information about deep sleep Heart beat per minute analysis is good   DND auto feature is fine and no calls or messages push appears while sleeping   Find my phone is awesome feature to find phone if kept silent But weather is not able to synch with mi fit app and its bit disappointing 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  can not ask for more for the tracker   app combination at this price  though the package is nowhere close to Fitbit s capability  However  it will be good if Mi Fit app integrates with Strava and takes inputs from Smart Scales like ActiveX 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Product is good  some functionalities are somewhat accurate but gives false numbers for other functions  Ex Workout    FreeStyle    Shows nonsense data even if a person is idle or relaxed 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Booked this on  st flash sale on  st OctoberAnd bang      Got delivered on  nd October instead of delivery date of  rd OctoberPros Great piece of work Handy and has great gripSceen is now bigger  compared to mi band   ConsBattery is less performing as compared to what they are pitchingIf you does not have smart band     Sure go for MI Band  But there are rerely any significant differences in band   and  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This is my first band and its way too Nice in looks and Functionaly FEATURES  Little Bigger DisplayWatchfaceHeartrateStressBreathingMusic controlCamera controlMagnetic Cable  Very Usefull I feel they could have released this in various colorI thought of buying Teal but only black is available PerfectBand  LessPrice  MuchFeatures
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Lacks accuracy when compared to Honor band        at this price point can not expect much    sleep tracking is offbeat  step count is offbeat  heartrate sensor is offbeat     it is good for alarm  stopwatch  timer   for viewing time   date 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  No SPO    Data is not syncing  Steps and sleep tracking is not accurate I suggest to buy honor band   it has accurate tracking 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Band is nice but band strap is too bad  I have used this watch for   months after that i lost it because of low quality stap it disappeared from my wrist  Stap quality and locking needs to be improved  I request do not buy mi band because strap is not safe on the wrist 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is good for      you can not expect much but does the job just apply some screen guard for longer life
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The battery is unbelievable  It charged for about   hours and lasted more than    days  The best part about this band is the battery  I do believe that the step counting accuracy is pretty inaccurate  but that is okay to some extent  Watch s user interface and mobile app go perfectly together  it is a joy to use this device  It charges to full in about   and a half hour and lasts for about    days with moderate use 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Waste of money my      ruppe i am thinking that it is correct and good but company make me fool I do not no the how to contact customer care but i knew that in  months later the customer care person told me that i am go to the customer care but here to nearest customer care distance is     km what can i do i am a student and for this band i will pay      and now I will go to customer care for check how I manage money for travel and food for one day  My band problem is it is do not show correct data this screenshot is prove that
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Hi This is a wonderful product for the price  Pretty much value for money when compared to more expensive options in the market  I feel this band is suitable for people who are looking to monitor their physical activity and also get some motivation to engage in some physical activity by increasing step count or atleast their physical conditioning  Accuracy seems to be more or less fine and is a great deal at the price  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have just got the mi band   today and within few hours  I received this weird display issue  Basically in simple way the pixels in the mi band got burned when it remains on for few minutes  For example when it tried updating by itself  A simple update button was showing but after that the update button remained in the back as a shadow  Initiated a refund  let us see if the next item shows the same problem 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was using mi band    forn version country Ukrain  I buyed Mi band   on            then in September      i got the news of mi band   i got excited and started to search the features of it   Then today I got the delivery and my experience with Amazon and Mi band   was very good it have very good features it tells us accurate steps   heart rate etc  And special thanks to Amazon for providing me a Good service with a satisfying price Thanks Amazon 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  It seemed okay in the beginning  But in due course  I observed the stress tracking over minutes was erratic implying some issue with reading The sleep tracking has also started showing strange recordings over time  The naps are misread  Sitting for long sometimes is recorded as naps  So the accuracy of product is doubtful Mobile app seems okay  More animated options could be added for home screen Overall an average product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The band is good for normal usage looks sturdy and strong build   battery is a plus point last for     days usually   Accuracy is medium need some more improvement   Overall can buy for regular usage and some motivation 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was waiting for oneplus band but was disappointed after seeing their low performance  Mi   band was my standby choice  I bought this as i found oneplus band not worth buying  Overall it is nice item to buy  Stand on the mark of performance  I recommend this 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I would like to thank the Amazon team for helping me  First when I ordered it get a fake product  Then as I contacted them they assured me that I will get the original product and I really got it    Great support from team Amazon  Update  it also track sleep very precisely  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  If to take this product for accuracy then i will not recommend you to buy this but you are casual person who want to buy this product for normal daily usage then you should go for this productSleep tracking      not so goodMobile app      comfortableAccuracy        Battery      Important note IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT MAKE SURE FIRST YOU ORDER SCREEN PROTECTION BECAUSE IN NORMAL USAGE YOU GOT LOTS OF SCRATCH ON AT SCREEN
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Nice band  Good felling and build quality  Nice and bright display  Great overall experience   The sleep tracking is over    per  accurate the mi fit app is great with a friendly interface and easy to use But the heart tracking can still be improved and I expected SPo  feature tooo   Good battery backup and nice variety of wallpapers Best band at this price range Edit  after    days my display cracked and mi do not cover this in warranty      Nor they have a spare screen of the band    Sooo sad          I have shared the photo also     
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good track I am very impressed   Very good target heart rate in workoutsVary good battery lifeDisplayAccurate steps counting using the GPRS very good I am very impressed by this fitness band
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The overall build quality is superb  do not go with the negative reviewsThe accuracy for sleep tracking and steps count is also greatOnly the issue I see is the battery which anyways is not a big deal as it has magnetic charging plus no detach and attachment problemsI specifically bought it just for my health tracking on daily basis and I think this is my first morning with this and I am literally happy as it mentioned my even  m of awake status during last night when I woke up just to turn off the fan 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  A very genuine product from MI  With great accuracy skills   sleeo tracker is mind blowing      accuracy However the battery gets drain in     days and it is fine   Revolutionary Magnetic Charging cable is so innovative   Overall it is a must have device   completely satisfied with everything it gives   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very useful   charging is esey   fast   mi fit app also users friendly  iso   android both compatible   bt in this band missing oxigen meter   otherwise all is superb  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Never gives me accurate measures when walk   run or cycleing  Its totally get dependent on you mobiles phone  if phone pass right information it shows right  if phone gps legs its also leg with measures   its just a display to show your phones data  Sometimes i cycle for    km and it show me   km  Sometimes i just i sit in house and it show me      steps completed 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Excellent product I have used all mi bands     and    MI band has bigger display and some advanced features  However the battery life is less say    to    days whereas the earlier bands last for almost a month 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The watch keeps tracking your heart rate even when you have switched the feature off in the settings  This heart rate is not shown on the device and only the ones manually measured are shown  Also  location should be enabled for the watch to pair with phone  It is really unnecessary for a bluetooth device to connect to a phone This is a Chinese tracking device that has health data of many Indians  I regret purchasing it  Avoid at all costs 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I think you people no need to think to buy this product  because we can believe and can trust mi Now about Band  This is such good product withAmoled colour touch screeen display  I fell in love  with this bands display Many features you can love that Its at good and decent price for middle class persons and can buy Mainly it is good for female this time Mi band   a true product 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros   AMOLED display is awesome  all notifications with full details full msgs  whatsapp reply  maps  etc  Notify for Mi app   magnetic charger  light weight  amazing battery  fast touch response  custom wallpaper  cool looks with different strap colorsCons   display small but value for money
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Have been using this mi band   for almost   months now and it has almost become like a part of my body  The sleep tracker facility is good and is accurate  There is     accuracy for step counter  I get a battery life of around       days easily for single charge  The calls and sms notification is a good feature  Due to which my phone is in silent mode only for past two months 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Honestly the accuracy is very far from normal  A little accuracy is in heart rate  But the step count is very inaccurate  In that case this is a stupid fitness band it is better to add extra money to buy a better and accurate one 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent device with a add on NAP records gives a additional benefit to know your sleeping pattern for those who like afternoon nap Accuracy is good enough as it helps for comparison of your own history Yet to use yoga function and PAI
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Product is good but battery not working more than    days fast charging loosing after all tracking stop   In Band   after stop all tracking battery running compliantly     days also  So I am not satisfied for Mi Band  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The overall build quality is Good  the accuracy is also nice  sleep tracking is not much accurate so I do not use it  The problem I have is with the activity detection  when I bought it and started using  it was not there but after a update it started  Earlier it used to sense quickly that I am walking and immediately started the walking workout timer  But after the update it takes too much time  almost     metres  to start it  that is the only problem rest all is AMAZING 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Very good fitness tracker with some glitches    Will start counting walking steps if you are travelling in a car over rough bumpy roads   Will not record any sleep data if you sleep for a while in the afternoon
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I buy it on  st day sale   specially for outdoor cycling exercise tracking but it failed  It only track time   calories burned but distance   speed tracking is not working  So   due to zero distance covered   your whole cycling process is not save measured  i e waste of expectations   band s battery     I wrote a feedback   today I received a firmware update but it still not working   Think twice before buying  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Please do read this before buying it I did liked the product and features The time it took to charge completely sometimes took longer The only downside of the product is its locking mechanism  trust me I lost mine as the lock undid itself and fell off and I could not recover it even after looking for it  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using it for just   days  Well  it has some really useful features like the workout modes and the menstrual cycle tracking I tested it with trade mill but it did not track the date   It was getting paused every now and then  The newly added PAI seems like a good addition but I have little doubts about the accuracy   The step counting is almost accurate  You have a lot of watch faces to choose from  In short   the Mi Band   is good and you can go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I loved the band   Its a multi tasker   In a busy life you can keep an eye on ua health nd the lifestyle you r living jst within seconds with this band     stars frm myside to Amazon for its fast n safe delivery   Hats off to the entire team which manages to deliver the product and passes on frm a branch to other no matter what the time is 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I like all the features of the mi band   this I accurate but not at sleep traking at the price for      we will expect spo  also but great fitness ban
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The device is good for tracking days activity with basic features   Although I am sure about the accuracy of the product as far as calories burning  I noticed somewhere between   to   calories is getting burnt per minute in any activity selected from workout tab  but that is not the case if you do not select the workout being done   As far as step count is concerned I fee it somewhere matches with my health app data  Satisfied with it since this is my first fitness band
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Everything is good with this one  whatever features the band has  it does well  The only   missing features would be oxygen level and inbuilt GPS  not a big deal though   You need to open the app on phone before tracking an activity like jogging or walking   It uses the phones GPS  Happy with the price and quality of the product  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is a useful product   But I cnt understand why Amazon just for the sake of    Indian grand festival    fool customers by increasing the mrp  and selling it at         rs discount   For example this mi band   is of worth rs      and their showing orginal price rs      and selling it at rs        Please guys stop this  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Its great health band with many upgradations like quality sleep  various additional workouts  stress and breathing etc  But at the same time lacks SPO  and NFC  even nap are not recorded does not record BP  Water reminders is Not available Other vitals which are available in Zepp app 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I did not slept at all in afternoon  yet this band reads data of   hrs sleep  I walked for a distance of approx   km  it shows      kms of walking distance   it is just horrible  This is review after single day usage   I do not know that what will happen after few months  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  This Device is Just Ok for You  Cons   Step Tracking is not accurate because if you are driving bike or travelling like in bus   and because of that your rist is moving a little it starts considering that as steps and increase step count  So step count is not accurate  Buy it for not missing your calls and just to see time and who is calling   But as tracker it is not accurate 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Step count  very inaccurate always displays too muchSleep track  very good and accurate but band is sometimes is not able to track napsPAI   does not seem much useful to me
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome product  As I am using mi band since band   was launched  I used         mi bands  But this mi band   is really superb  Large display   bright color  touch response is quite good as compared to band   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Compared to other products It is completely not worth it  You must read terms and conditions before buying it as they cannot repair the product  they can only replace it and if any dent or scratch is found on the product they will not replace it  it is a watch and dents are very normal in it  My problem started misfunctioning immediately after     months of buying it and they will not repair it as it has   small cracks on the screen Worst experience with a product Shame on this 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  This band is a nice quality item  It falls back on accuracy   It even tracks heartbeat when the band is off and that is surprising   It even tracks steps when I am sleeping n I do  not do sleep walking   Very unhappy with the results as it should have been good with accuracy considering it as a fitness band  Only the add on features are good like music control  camera shutter weather updates etc 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  My review after   week   friends I have faced so many problems in Mi Smart Band   like nap not count I have seen second time nep not count at last night            I sleep at   pm to      pm band not show last   days ago that sleep count   am that is wrong I sleep    pm and minutes Some time walking mode on all performance done but distance not show again walking mode on that show I have also used Honor Band   best as compared to Mi Smart Band    About battery normal not good Thank you
Smartdevices,4,CG,  not good in accuracy specially in sleep tracking   foot step tracking  battery backup is awesome     good looking and awesome quality of straps       screen quality is quite good     especially used it for time   call msg notification    and good water proofing    durable    overall   star      
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This is my first smart watch  so writing this review without other experience  it is working good so far  senses even minute activity  The best part is the sleep tracker  My sleep schedule was irregular before this  but the tracker motivated me to get it in order  Step and exercise trackers work fairly well  I work out so it is good to know how much progress I have made  Go for it   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  If you are just beginning your fitness journey  this band is definitely worth itscost effective investment  because it will truly keep you motivatedIt s accurate  light  and rugged   perfect companion for ones fitness journey
Smartdevices,3,CG,  It enabled my Bluetooth automatically once it was successfully connected  I open my phone to see Bluetooth on and got scared about the security of the product  Because it has access to all notifications  phone calls  phone book  messages and every other thing on my phone  Hence returned it 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I highly doubt if its tracking my steps accurately coz I have been using this band since last night       AM till now  that is      PM and it shows      steps and I know for sure I have not been doing anything than just lying down and walking in and around my house So kindly fix it please 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Amoled display looks good  Get more accurate results  Better charging Socket Comfortable in Hands Good built quality Butcalorie count    Once you start any exercise it always count calories whether you do it or not Otherwise overall good In terms of calorie count it lacks
Smartdevices,4,OR,  One of the initial issues I faced with the band was the difficulty to take the tracker out of the band  I like using various colored bands  so this was a desired requirement for me  The customer manual did not help  here is what i did  Invert the band  and then push the tracker out of the band  If you check the manual it says  pop the tracker out using the support of a finger  that did not work out for me  Invert the band and then try  might help   
Smartdevices,5,OR,      The quality of the band is premium quality    Activity tracker accuracy is very Good    Water resistant excellen    Battery     to    days runs well    According to me  this is the best watch for less money  it has all the other thingsI feel that in this budget  it is just a collection of money and it is also a good
Smartdevices,4,OR,  My review after    days of moderate usage Battery life is amazing  as seen in the picture I have charged it    days ago and it still has     battery leftSleep tracking was not very accurate but close enoughThe experience on the mobile app is amazingAccuracy  however is around        when it comes to step count and detection via workouts such as walking  jump rope etcMoreover  totally worth it if ur a first time experimental user like me 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  What a quantum leap over mi band    Brilliant display  Loads of features   i am yet to figure out many Very accurate in tracking workout  heart rate etc  Links well to my mobile for notifications Truck loads of watch faces available Overall  very happy with this 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This is a great option   the size of the watch has increased compared to MI band    Magnetic charger is also very usefull   lot of good watch faces are also there   the MI fit app is good but has some small bugs  It does not opens when we open some URLs   other than that the sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring is accurate  a Spo  monitor should be added but it is not there   other than that this watch is a great buy   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Full on value for money  I loved the accuracy of sleep monitoring  it is precise   Very useful  Completely satisfied with this   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The sensor works pretty well and the strap is comfortable enough for wearing       I have been tracking my sleep cycle from last week and it works pretty well  The mi fit app works fine and from  rd party app you can get more than thousands watch faces  I wish it comes with different color as black is to common but for that you have to buy separately now  Also it is bright enough to see in daylight  I have uploaded the photos go check it out 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice product    thank you amazon for lighting fast delivery  nice band compare to mi band   and honor band    large display  good battery backup  more accurate stress level   sleep monitor  and heart measurements  If you want full experience of this band you can download mi fit app 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Sleek design  compatible mobile app  Steps tracking is quite accurate and reliable but sleep tracking is totally in accurate No response from the technical team despite regular follow ups
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Overall a good product with bigger display  smooth touch experience and lots of useful features But the connectivity issues are really a disadvantage of this band  Each time it disconnected after clearing recent apps and take much time to reconnect  Many times it does not received sms and other app notifications  Step count are also not accurate nearly     correct  takes false steps wity your movement of hand 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This band is really helpful for me  I use to wear it while I do my daily work out and it helps to track the calories I burn  Sleep tracking is really good  The band when connected to the app  can do many functions which is really helpful for anyone  The stress monitor  breath exercise  alarm etc is very good  it is been three months since I began to use this  The battery capacity is awesome  can last upto two weeks 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is my first time using a mi band  The best fitness band with so many features  the values shown seems pretty much accurateMy most favourite option is record of menstrual cycle  is the best cuz I always need a app for the date reminder band makes it easier Accuracy of sleep  deep sleep  REM is cool and the fit me app is organised perfectlyNo glaring errors seen overall it is the budget band with so many features including the battery n its magnetic charger 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Lots of good features with all new MI band   A good start of your day with a vibrating alarm along with the sleep quality tracking  Multiple ways to track your activities  workouts and most imp is the stress level monitoring and Idle alert  Really good to have such features with thousands of cool watch faces along with personalisation Worth having one   
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Battery performance is poor last till   days  and it is straps is of bad quality  it tracks sleep record from      to      only and naps  it is worst than mi band    Better but band   no refund policy too 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It has good looks and decent battery life  Sleep  steps count and heart rate tracking work well  However it seems to not get the stride length correct while outdoor running  So the distance measured is half of the distance actually run  Considering the price tag of         it is good value for money 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Sleep tracking is good for night but little inaccurate for day sleep Steps count is not so accurate Battery life is     days for continuing sleep and heartbeat tracking Heartbeat monitoring is good Fitting is nice Comfortable in wearing Strap quality is very good I bought it       on   oct 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Writing the review after   daysI bought this product during the  st sale of mi band  It was delivered to me on the  nd day  sunday I charged it toll      on that day and it gave an impressive battery life of   days  Sleep tracking with REM was turned on I workout  times a day  approx  hrs  and will use workout mode during my workout The brightness was set on  th level Call alerts and message alerts were turned on And got   days of battery life 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Heart rate sensor showing reading without even wearing the band    showing random values without wearing   it may fix with a software update   other than that   it is a good band    so many customisation options    but some neglible scratches can occur within a week if you use it daily  overall a good band with slightly high pricing   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Amazing device  was waiting for it since quite a few months  finally bought it on the  st day of sale  looks good and is super accurate  wish it had NFC and SPO  but worth the price 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Though it claims it can measure naps longer than    minutes  from a week long experience of mine it is thoroughly incapable of recognising naps  And while using cycling mode the time is shown in a very low digit size such that one should stop the bicycle and take the help of a lens to view time  And it would have been better had the band been capable of alerting us of the calls without that delay of a few seconds  Also the pedometer should have been more accurate  Otherwise 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  After using more than one week I am adding a review  st  the accuracy is not proper in mi band    in mi band   the accuracy is good  nd battery backup is good  rd in mi   band whenever you raise hand up it will show you the status automatically like the status of your workout  in mi   band that feature is missing overall ok 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Overall A superb Smart Band with many smart Fitness features likeBPM MonitoringStress Monitoring   Work out mode including YogaI Liked Smart Features more than Fitness FeaturesFrom time to TimerMusic to CameraEverything Is superbI Think this battery will last for       DaysThe major Con or negative I felt Is No SPO  CalculatorBut the price      is just WOWWW   I can not believe how they can sell this for this price   
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Does not count steps accurately As far as the hear rate and sleep is concerned  I am not sure about that but gives satisfactory information Gives pretty detailed info about sleep and stress level Its my  th day with the band on  battery lv is     with sleep tracking an heart rate monitoring on Overall  I am satisfied  just wanted the step counts to be accurate 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent value for money    Instant response to calls and messages    Display looks Outstanding at this price range  Got it at         with Amazon Coupon and Cashback   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am posting this review after using of     days  it is awesome product  I was waiting for this from long time  Sleep tracking  stress level  heart rate monitor etc was vary good and accurate  I bought this product        it is awesome deal with     cashback of Amazon paylator
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I do not know what to say about this product  This is just a big all rounder and an amazing smart band  I bought a Mi Band   last year and I still love it a lot  And at the same price here is it is successor with a lot more features  And I am going to be very honest with you  this is the best smart band at this price  Just go for it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Keeping  Covid  situation  in  mind     Spo  level  checking could  have  been  a  game  changer  for them    But  over  all  good
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The quality of this band is really good  and the app works great  Heart rate monitor does a good job  and workout detection features is impressive  And the options of watch faces are like in hundreds  but when it comes to sleep tracking  I am kind of disappointed because till now using this product for like month it did not even track my sleep once  I do not know why but it did not  Although the Band works really fine you could buy it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Absolutely brilliant build quality  I lost my watch while swimming in a cannal  After couple of days I luckily got it back from the bottom of the cannal when water flow was stopped  The watch spend   days on the bottom of the cannal which was having more than   feet of water  When I got it back It was perfectly in same condition  I really appreciate the build quality 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great product does almost all the work at a very affordable price   Step Count   Heart rate monitor   Stress level calculator   Monthly period cycle tracker   Idle alert   Call and app notifications   Music control   Camera access   Great Battery  goes for     days without charge with all functions For first time band buyers a good product 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Heart rate tracking is very poor and exercise mode is sham  Bad product  My treadmill shows heart rate     and mi band is still showing     really frustrating 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Mi smart band   really smart desreves    stars it is a great band my previous band was honor band   and it is great upgrade trust me if you avoid spo  than go for it best upgrade from mi band   very accurate and brilliant features thanks Amazon and xiaomi best accurate product mi band I loved it and it is features like camera world clock stress is best and breathing exercise and   extra workout modes best on best      
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have compared almost all the metrics with standard products  The results are not very accurate  At least heart rate it could tell accurately  but NO  Try with two different bands together and you will know 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Battery life shown in specification was   weeks  but in actual scenario baatery complete in one week I have purchased this product and I went to some other place on official duty travelling mode not constant stay   My retun policy was completed on            but I want to return this product after checking the performance  So please provide me one opportunity to return this product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Step Counter             captured vs Actual steps taken Heart Beat        almost accurate Distance     Sleep        mostly there Nap       failed to capture few naps across a week Display     Built     Overall for the price you pay you would feel satisfied 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  When full app notification is on battery life is  or   days max accuracy is also an issue as margin of error is greater than clinical instrument finding  but barring this it good to have this to be aware of fitness regime
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Purchased MI Band   a few days ago  Noticed that the step count is totally wrong  If you take    steps then it is counting    steps  Or if you run for   km it is counting as       steps and sometimes more  Not sure if customer service is listening  The band needs to calibrated correctly  How to correct this  The purpose of this band is not fulfilledOther features such as heartbeat  breathing  stress are a good touch
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I charged it fully on March  th and tbe battery ran out on March   th  It was running on full stretch with heart rate monihor on always etc I think its good battery backup    days is pretty good 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Man this watch delivers more than it says  I got    days of battery  Continuous heart rate monitoring was not required to me so  I used for notifications  sleep tracking is just superb  I was amazed to see at what time I slept and at what time I woke up  I  work in night shifts so I sleep till afternoon and it did not consider it as nap  instead as a full sleep so the watch is simply perfect man for health monitoring 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Such a good band   The display actually very good  it is a very bright display with    nits and the magnetic charger is going to be selling point of this band  sleep tracking is much improved  battery life already  days still    left  The accuracy of heartbeat tracking is constant 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Well  a good product in this price range  If the same features were given by some Indian company then would have felt better  The package was damaged  although the product was alright 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Pros Comfortable to wearWater proofLong battery life   Lasts more than a weekGood Bluetooth connectivity to appAccurate about stepsAdjustable strapHeart rate sensor is accurate  I compared it with an oxymeter  It was almost the same ConsSmall screenPedometer is at times counting steps even when you are driving
Smartdevices,4,CG,  After using for more than   months  I would post and honest and Simple Review     Step Tracking        Accurate    Sleep Tracking          Accurate    All Workout Modes are         Accurate    Heartbeat Sensor        Accurate    All other features including band material  PAI  Weather  Calls Acceptance and Rejection work and are absolute fine 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it can be considered as the best band in india   but the problem is that its not that much accurate and its price should be      or      because           does not makes the band worth it  The problem is that the heart rating system is not accurate   if you keep the band on a non living thing  it would give a fake heart rate  But yes there are some improvements in this band   But still i suggest you mi band   or OnePlus band  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I loved it  accuracy bit off but  it is fine no band is accurate sleep data is not accurate at all and mifit app is not great  use other apps  and watch face is superb litterlly unlimited and you can set your pic too
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The whole Products is goodValue for money  and it is also have call answering on it but you have Bluetooth earphones  charging is also super it is have over to    days and charging is very Fastly inputting Waste of money buying      or      Watches because they have call answering and replying if you want to bt calling smart watch then you spent        onlySo no options you definitely go to this band   watch
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Amazon delivered it earlier than expected  not even a single issues  Band works well  Touch screen has improved both in size and response  Heart rate sensor is     accurate  I tested it with my mums ECG  The Haptics has improved  If the band fits your wrist perfectly  you can wake up from the vibration of the band Overall everything is good  You might want to buy a spare band  I do not think it will last   that is all
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Initial impression is goodVery good displayGood touch responseStrap quality got improvedCharging is hassle freeFurther review will be posted after   week of usage 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The band is good with add on of some new features and battery back up bt trust me the activity tracking are so false and gives terrible output which is nt even near of tha actual results like if you walk only    steps it will count    steps and so on    Well I will never recommend it over honor band   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Totally worth the price  The quality is great and also the battery packup  It can run upto    days in a single full charge There are some new option and some more accuracy in sleep tracking or stress All in all  it is a cool product in a good price 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it is performance is better than MI Band  The display quality is awesomeThe build quality is really goodThe heart rate monitor works very accuratelyIt is a value for money And thank you Amazon for fast delivery 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Vry bad it even calcuate heart rate when not wearing    steps not accurate  Iam vry dissapointed
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It is amazing band   But I think if you want to buy mi band you should purchase mi band   because it is available around      as compared to me band    There is not much difference between mi band   and    The only difference is that the size and some features are extra in mi band    And it also demand for money to use some features which is not good all over it is good fitness band   I love these products 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Poor battery life not long lasting more than   days  Low connectivity  it shows connected but incoming calls stop showing after one or two calls  Also poor strap very bad quality of rubber band  I loved only the music and camera controlling features  I felt waste of money for buying this product  Disappointed experience  I hope the performance and quality will be improved by mi band 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This is good for the quick read of notifications  Once i started to track my cycling So I have opened and clicked on the start the track in the watch and it is asking me to open Mobile app  I would say watch is getting sync always with mobile app  Then i just opened Mobile app  henceforth it starts sync  Not a great product but a good one for this price Mi accuracy in heart rate and steps as well 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  MI BAND   THE REVIEW WILL BE GIVING BY ME WITH MY HAPPIENESTHE DISPLAY IS WAS SO AWSUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMBATERY LIFE WAS TO GOOD I WAS USING FORM   DYS ONLY    BATTERY AS BEEN USED STILL     AS THEIR THE GREAT BATERY LIFE   BRIGHTNES  ALL FEATURES AS BEEN DEVLOPED VERY BEAUTIFUL AS COMAPRED TO OTHER COMPANY BANDPLEASE GO FOR BEAUTIFUL LOOKING FOR A BAND I LOVED ITT     THANKU SO MUCH FOR MI BAND     
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This is my first time   I just got strap and Invoice in it   I knew this must not happened by amezon   But may be by Currier boy or other one      But I am facing this problem by very large time     You can buy this band because it is happened only with me  Other reviews are best    But this time I am unsatisfied with amezon  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I bought this product as an aide for fitness tracking but this product is having connectivity issues only after using it for   days  Amazon is also not being much kind by taking taking this gadget in return  It has only given me replacement option  Both of them have given me ill responses 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Everything is ok but for music control and notifications I had to install a third party app called Notify for Mi band  Music control and notifications is not accessible with the official Mi fit app  Apart from all these  everything is perfect  Go for it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Product delivered without factory seal  Somebody opened and used or did a trial and repacked using ordinary tape  Inside covers for the band and charging cable are missing  LOSING TRUST ON AMAZON DELIVERY 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Worth the money spent on this  Tracking is comparable as compared to other pedometer apps and distance is also approximately similar to the Google maps  Only issue I am genuinely facing is while tracking through GPS  It does not work perfect capturing  Overall while comparing with other available trackers this is the best in same range
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Every time I start the exercise mode   yoga walking  treadmill   it either shuts down immediately or else keeps pausing every minute or two  Totally defeats the purpose of wearing it if I have to keep restarting it every minute   very disappointed with the product  I used MI   band for over a year and it still works perfectly and only bought this one for the yoga feature but it does not work  I request a replacement 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I am writing this review after   days of usage  Battery lasted for   days  from     to      with continuous BPM and stress monitoring enabled  pretty decent  Sleep tracking is almost accurate  well designed app for the band is a plus  With minimal features usage battery can last longer  Best fitness tracker option at this price range 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I am writing this review after   months of purchase  I am not sure Heart beat rate is correct  It even count the steps while going on the bike  Steps count is also not accurate  Bluetooth range lasts for upto   meters       charging comes for   week  For this features      rupees is the best price for this band  it is upto you wether to buy buy or not 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Like sleep tracking is great but not      accurate but that is the case with most bands and watcheslove the fact it can be used in the showerexcellent battery back up of       daysmagnetic charging is handyDislike No built in GPS
Smartdevices,1,CG,  worst product campared to mi previous products always issue with bluetooth connectivity and we should connect manually and sync manually not accurate on stress  bpm naps REM steps music  camara  can not get massages alert  battary also died within   week  my best suggestion pls do not go for this   
Smartdevices,3,CG,  can not see any thing in bright sun light  After    days band gets loose and it comes out while removing shirts or t shirts   During sun light it is of no use it is a wastage of money
Smartdevices,5,OR,  If your are a step counter geek or your are in serious activity than i would recommend it till some limit  But for better results you should checkout gqoii or gqooi which has better activity tracker or amazefit verge lite  If you are a tech geek otherwise you will be comfortable with it also  It performs well  Only scope of improvement is step count otherwise all good  Mi did a good job  Happy with it  Another       years to go with it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The watch is good for your daily activities  Shows accurate information   Guess it is worth the money  The battery life is really good and many new features been added 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Step counting and heart rate monitoring is reliable I am using the band to measure the heart rate  while doing cross trainer  Breathing practice exercises excellent  Sleep tracking and calorie count needs further improvement
Smartdevices,5,CG,  One of the best in the range Sleep accuracy is much better Heart Rate accuracy is Fine Steps accuracy is around    Idle alert is another good feature Call SMS alert and display works fine in the band  Only drawback i experienced is when I am taking my hands in forward and backward directions  as if I am walking tho I am not  it is counting as steps  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  One of my best purchase  it is sleek and very comfortable to wear  The battery life is really good just like it is mentioned  I wear it everyday  The best part is that it is waterproof  Also  great for girls as it records the period cycle  The list goes on   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Likes    build quality soft material  display quality  lot of functionsDislikes    sometimes it does not connect with other phones except Mi  not exact results  some functions are totally useless likes stress monitoring  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Heart beat is not accurate and battery life      days not as mentioned Even if you do not wear your band it is showing Hearbeat rate SPO  function  is not available 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The app is glitchy  it does not connect to Google Fit properly so you can not track your health in any third part apps like Fitso or Nike Training app  This was why I had wanted a band in thw first place so for me it is pretty useless  It tracks your heart rate  sleep and steps alright but if you can not really use that data how you want to  what is the point 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Likes Battery life is very good Heart rate monitor works reasonably good Dislike Screen size and resolutionSleep tracking is not accurate compare to honor band  Distance measuring is not accurate compare to honor band  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Not as good as advertised or expected The sleep monitoring does not work at all for two days i have tried no results Battery also draining fast Updated reviewThe replacement watch has a lag to show call notification very sad products we are getting 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Good for its price  This is the first time I bought a fitness band  It has all the basic features  Best feature is that you can control music with this band  I use Wynk music and was apprehensive if that would be controlled by this band or not  I am glad it did  So you can use your music apps and this would work smoothly with that also 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The band is showing heart rate and stress level even if I do not wear it  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The mi fitness band   is really amazing but the  annoying part is the sensor always beeps even we do not wear it but keeping that a side the accuracy is good and there are lot of watch faces and has a quiet few features then the earlier version   Hope this is helpful
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Calculate Distance travel  PAI  sleep etc  Can handle music through it  It wouldd have been great if it can use for receive call for now it calls can be rejected or made silent through band 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  General verdict is same as other reviews but so far I have been disappointed by steps measurement they are not accurate at all  Like even moving my arms while standing still will make the band count those movements as steps hope mi fixes this issue 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Honor band   is much better 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Almost no accuracy when measuring steps  Though the delayed alerts stopped but phone call alerts coming after the actual ring is over or phone is picked up  Tried twice with a replacement but problem persist the same 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought my lifes first fitness band mi   and it does not even on  So I returned the product the same day and  the next day within few hours of pick up  I received the money  in my bank account   now I am going to buy again mi    hoping it would work well this time eventhough I did not even use the product I am giving   starts on the basis of other mi products which I have used 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros Works well  I use for tracking continuous heartrate  outdoor cycling and sleep analysis  Battery life is good  Need to charge only once a week Cons The steps keep counting when doing other workouts cycling Very sensitive to touch  workout could get reset on touch of dropslets or worn clothes 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  frankly speaking waste of money if you buy this productin real life you can not use this things as much as you think before buying because you do not have a time in your lifethere is lots of hype about of fitness tracker  i also get trapped in this hype and purchased one fitness tracker called mi band   and i regret myself
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Music always gives error as song not found and there is no lab option in One Plus mobile  Both features are not usable
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I do not like this band   and I return also    Because it is accuracy is not correct  And watch is work after connect from mi fit app  And heart tracker is also take time of       sec   But it is also not accurate  And overall good band but very overpriced in our catogery of price       and I also say that please no one buy this watch   because band quality is not good for big and healthy hands   and after it is your choice   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very useful product Initially I disliked it as it was not remaining synced with mobile  Later I realised that the App needed some privileges  After doing that  Its a perfect gadget now Very useful in both fitness side and call sms and alert management 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I compared with honor band    It is less accurate in every department than honor  Even if you turn off heart rate monitoring it will still monitor heart rate  green light   Those software based features like stress are of no use  Only battery life and customisation of watch faces is better than honor  Else for accuracy honor band   is still better and cheaper 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The Band is working quite perfectly  Providing accurate data of all my activities it has multiple workout mode it helps to calculate the calories burnt  provide notifications in unique way  Battery Backup is more than   days if i enable all its features like heart rate monitor  sleeping  notifications etc Band   has magnetic charger its very easy to connect band with charger Very satisfied with this product 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Have been using it for a month and really love it  I read a review faq saying it gives two weeks battery but it gives only one week  That its water proof is great 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Just delivered    Fast delivery by Amazon  am already user of mi band    when this band   released in China there this supports spo  monitoring but in Indian version it is not there     So am giving  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I like sleep tracking  heart rate pure accurate But the step tracking is not much accurate  It can be clear ed by a ota update Best band under      I got it for    k Better than one plus band  Malayalathill parannaaalKollam pwli sanam  Close your eyes and go and buy Also battery performance is best in class  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  So I am a user of Mi band   and Band   Spec wise i could say the Band   packs a punch and is definitely better than its previous brothers  I could this the besy for this price range  One thing i found a bit odd was the display smoothness  I do not know if that is because its new and will get better   but it feels like the display on the band   is more smooth  i can not say better but its smoother to drag and swipe 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am recently turning into some fitness junkie and this device is so cool and sturdy I am loving it  With its beautiful UI and amazing tracking capability it is very useful 
Smartdevices,5,CG,    stars  Good display  responsive  nice apps  good battery  have not tried the workout party yet so can not comment on that yet   Btw change the watchface with cooler ones once you buy it  There are lots of apps on playstore  One thing that annoys me is that you can not set alarms directly on the band  You have to do it on your phone 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I really love the band  Step count and heart beat accuracy is top notch  Added sport modes are a blessing  Sleep tracking works fine  An update could make the sleep tracking more accurate Watch faces are also pretty nice  Go for it if you are planning to buy a mid range fitness tracker 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This is a very very good fitness band I love it  Just the thing is that it misses the most important thing in these days blood oxygen monitoring also known as spo   It is also missing alexa voice assistant  Amazfit band   is better than the mi band   but I think it is not launched here yet  Mi band   is also coming in June so maybe you can wait for that But a very good buy 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was really a good decision to buy Mi band   for me  Display Quality  User interface  Application interface and Battery performance is outstanding  Thousands of watch face with the support of third party app  just go for it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this watch in October sale  it was working very well but the wrist strap was very cheap as this became loose  I lost this today while driving bike  After   month of uses it became loose  even while doing workout it felt from my hand many time  I urge MI to use good quality of wrist strap like realme which is just launched or can take example of samsung smart watch strap 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The band is good  Involves a number of workouts and the tracking is almost accurate But the app can be improved a lot  Very few analytics available in the app compared to the data collected Also  there are numerous problems when you want to sync the data with Google fit or any other application 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Using since Monday after mi band    It has lot of new features but calculations are not good  Even while walking it stops  Automatic detection happen after     mins of walk 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I hv recvd my order in morng but I am opening it now I can not on power May be it is not charged  When I will be in my home after   hrs I will try again I am here sending information only 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Works great Not much different from the previous  version Just a bit of nuances here and there I bought it for the magnetic charger as taking the capsule out of the band was such a hassle for me 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I loved this product so much I bought it on    October it is so good and its accuracy is also good but if you wave ur hands it calculate that in the steps  But sleep tracking is so good that it shows when I was awake and for how many mins  This was really appreciatable  Searching for a fitness tracker with good accuracy  you may buy this one And at last the heart rate monitoring is also accurate 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I do not think the calories burnt measured by this device is correct Last day it showed I had burnt around      calories in a single day  Which I do not think is accurate  Although I had played squash in the evening and gym in the morning  But including all of that my count could not have gone above     or           was way above the scale 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I really love this mi band  It is a very nice product but some dislike things are       its battery is less  it only runs for   days only not for a week      This mi band   not support emojis and hindi language    sometimes its screentouches are not working properly its screen is so big really but battery is small why 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  It gives absolutely wrong heart rate reading specially during workouts  I tried it even after replacing the product and have also reported several times to Mi fit team along with app and band log records but did not get any response  Honestly if you are buying it especially for workouts and heart rate monitoring  I will advise not to buy this 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Tracking issue is almost good  Really good band in this price range only issue is with its strap  Playing cricket while batting it is strap lock always come out that is not good  Locking option in strap as watch should be provided 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  even though the tracker is better than MI band    i got a severe rash  or burn i am still not sure  in first   days of constant use  the worrying part is that the rash only appeared where the tracker was located and not anywhere else on the strap part  i have used various other fitness bands from fitbit  Samsung and apple watch and never had such problem 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This waste of money productI purchased this and after    days of useIt stopped   when I gone to customer care there are very irrespective and said   this can not be no anything  I lost my money and respect for this brand and productI strongly oppose to this product to my friends and familyI will not suggest to anybody to this brand
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Mi   band as expected it is better then other in this price   it has extra exercise activities involved which is great    Me being rope jumper i find that very helpful    it is accuracy is        I have heard people saying it does not record nap time which is incorrect    It record nap time too  You will see the difference between other versions of mi band and this one   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Received it today and it looks nice and works well so far  Tried both iPhone and Android and works fine  Hope it keeps working  Guess for this price  its quite a good product 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Writing after   days of usage Battery life       Value for money      Accuracy    Sleep tracking      Activity tracking    Heart monitoring    Overall its a good product 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Battery down on    day to     used  features  as and when required   Did not expect  this much fast battery  drain 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I took it   months back  The steps  calorie count  and skipping count is inaccurate  Also it is losing its touch sensitivity  I am afraid it might stop responding to touch before long  So give this a skip  buy something else
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Hey guys     This watch is awesome and its features are also awesome but the only thing i regret is the battery life    They say that its battery life will last    days on a single charge but actually it lasts for like       days      Everyday about    to     battery reduces   So if you are looking for a battery efficient watch go for something else  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The only thing I doubt is it is accuracy  But if you use Gps and mobile with you  Then tracking is good  Battery will not last for more than   days of you use fittness and call alert facilities 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   If you have sensitive skin then do not buy it The heart rate sensors gives me little Electric shock all the time it triggers for monitoring my heart rates  And I got huge writs pain even though I ware band at normal fit So I have it to my wife  It works fine for her
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Records road journeys through vehicle as walking  Idle periods are considered as activity period  Sleep period record has got no relation with actual sleep period  sleep period is considered as awake period    its a wastage of money and energy  I want my money back 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  After using   month    In simple lines which every user wants to know    Quality is good  battery is min   days WID out charging  accuracy   out door running is bit erratic  but walking and sleeping track is almost     accurate   touch screen is  good  App is also good  bit unsatisfied WID belt
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The Mi smart band   is looks good and working fine  It is water resistance band but while washing hands little water fell on it   after that the locking screen looks it contain water inside   so felt bad  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Sleep tracking a vital feature for people so suffer from insomnia A must have product Stress monitor is another good feature for those who do not realise how stressed they are
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Looks wise we can not feel stylish bcoz it is smrtband light weight even not feel heavy   accuracy ok ok bluetooth conectivity and display user interface are realy great  dnt go heartmonitor verypoor stepscounting while driving  while walking it shows correct   percent   idle alerts not performing good they can do it wel by update  finaly magnetic charging is good   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  A very good device for casual monitoring purpose A watch to complement all your clothes  this trendy looking watch goes with almost everything i wear   just look fabulous on my wrist  The watch is quite comfortable as i wear it all day   night  The sleep tracking   Shows good workout time    countings   calories    whatsapp msgs preety usefull kids loved it   worth spending looks stylish  happy
Smartdevices,4,OR,  If you are looking to get into fitness and you do not want to spend much  go for this  If you are not keen on having in built GPS  Mainly for runners  go ahead and buy it  However  if you are a runner or an athlete who wants to get out of the home without your phone  I would suggest looking at the Amazfit Bip 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Accuracy is not good  even after you wake up it shows       steps  do not know maybe its too advanced that can count steps even in your dreams too i think go for honor band   is a better choice This is completely a dummy product 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This watch is completely worth to buy and my    year old son is enjoying it as his birthday gift  Its a best option if your looking for a budget friendly birthday gift  He was so happy to get this watch as a birthday gift  Completely satisfied  Love it  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I got cheated   The Mi smart band is missingWhen I opened the delivered package I got a damaged box of the product which was also not sealed  Inside the box there was only a charger and a manual book  The band was missing
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Mi band   and Mi fit both s    s  it is not at all accurate while measuring stuff like Sleep  Step  Stress tracking  PAI and BPM somewhat is good though I have not monitored these two from other bands  Alot of improvement required in both Mi Fit and Mi Band    till the time guys do not go for it unless or until you want to put your penny in bin 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Battery drains fast when psi is enabled this can be disabled in app but just had to say it  Looks good  feels light  helps me find my phone a lot of times because i forget where i keep it  Accuracy is good when it comes to steps  Heart rate needs better accuracy 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Totally Bogus product  please do not buy  It is duplicate china item that is being sold on Amazon  Tried returning  but item was not returnable  you can measure heart beats even without wearing the wrist watch  Total waste of money and time    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice look  Tracking is great  Light weight  Battery will not get till    days as company claims  If you turn on all activities then lasts about    days approx depends on the usages 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I love this product and excited to use further    However very disapointed tat this device does not hv pin lock option   A simple swipe unlocking the device  Probably any one can access n pair it with their device  Which is a big Con 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Trust me guys pls do not buy it  it is not all accurate  It counts wrong steps and sometimes give the too lower heart rate readings and sometimes it gives you too higher readings  then also it when it is not on your wrist  Such a worst product 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Steps measurement   heart rate measurement etc are not accurate   Band and MiFit app do not sync properly  Even after selecting outdoor running mode and running after  km it does not show the activity in app  Features are good but useless if they do not work accurately 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   This is my first time use with any fitness band   It is very good band for fitness tracking  Also step counter is good  It did not have spO  which is not big deal for me  because nobody used it after sometime  HR is alo accurate The only con is sometimes it count false steps but it is very negligible 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Worth buying value for money  you can choose this band in this price range very good product
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The PAI feature of this band is awesome  Now i know how much i need to exercise in a week  It increases motivation to workout and achieve a     PAI score every week 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  It is very inaccurate in step monitorAnd little inaccurate in heart rate and sleep monitorI have honor band   which is way accurate in every thing compare to thisI you want to buy for the shake of fitness band then buyIf you want accurate data go for honor band  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  First time user the experience is outstanding decent product but the battery is reduced is a disappointing factor but i appreciate the new features added into band overall perfect product go for it
Smartdevices,5,CG,  BEST BUDGET AND VALUE FITNESS BAND AND NO DOUBT MI A GOOD BRAND   STABILITY IS PERFECT   NO PAIRING IS ISSUE   HAS THE BEST OF NEW VERSION FEATURESI AM VERY VERY SATISFIEDTHANKS AMAZON FOR BRINGING THE INDIAN VERSION OF MI SMART BAND  THANK you
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Cost effective band in indian market with fair accuracy  GPS used with mobile apps sometimes fault and continuous heart rate monitoring drains battery very fast but it is not mentioned in details while marketing l 
Smartdevices,4,CG,    Heart Rate monitor is good but not very good    Mi Smart band   Build quality and look is excellent   Band strap build is good but not very good   Mi Smart band   with magnetic charger        it is excellent matching     and I am very happy   Mi Smart band   loading features are always helpful    Battery backup and performance is very good 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  i have received my order    Feb and after use of   or   day it is battery drains to fast around         within     days  Then I replace my order and after using my new band for    day I can say confidentially it is give you     day battery backup Screen quality is not so good with in   weeks     scratches appear on glass 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  You can not switch off this band by any means other then drain its battery to Zero Many times it takes heartbeat reading when it is actually not worn by anyone 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Accuracy is grossly out  A distance of  km comes up as     km A distance of    km was shown as    kmPace gets counted accordingly Many times even driving a car riding a cycle is calculated as Steps walked 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Impressive product nearly    If you have a limited budget or your a student   Then i will suggest you to go for it   I am using mi band   form nearly   days results are very good  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good product More than a fitness band Good display  Performs well even in sun light    day battery is with recommended optimization Strap quality is good Heart rate and step counting seems accurate do not know about stress monitoring addition of SPO  would have been Cherry on top
Smartdevices,4,CG,  So   look wise the product is just awesome  It lacks some features such as password lock which was present in mi band    but rest the band is just fab  In other fields the band   is far better than     and  th gen mi bands 
Smartdevices,1,OR,       in accuracy      When i am actually walking it barely counts and whenever i am doing nothing or just changing my clothes it vounts hundreds of steps within seconds      Really really disappointed     After reading all reviews i was sooo excited to buy but within    hours of using it      My excitement crashed in hell    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very happy with this band   Best in the class   it is amoled colouring display look fantastic nd it is give a superb look in your waist   Value for money  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is good not great not a worthy upgrade over mi band   or honour band   it lacks spo  feature in current condition and price I purchased it on   st sale and I am returning it because sales are comming on both Amazon and Flipkart soo wish me a luck that I find better one 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  It is so much better than the earlier Mi  that I had  This one correctly shows the slep and naps that I have had  It also tracks my Yoga exercise when I turn that on 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good Product  But the tracking of your calories is not true  I just switched to yoga and kept aside for   min after seeing the watch it shows     calories were burned  Just for smart watch satisfaction we can go ahead with this 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  As far as product is concerned it is perfect fitness band  Its value for money product  Mi always try to give many features in small pack 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I would recommend this over any other band at this price and this quality   and so many options  Easy to use and good battery backup and Display is simple nd even customizable
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome productMany good changes are doneVery good watch facesTruly satisfied with the productDelivery on time
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I would like to keep it short   I am happy with the band        battery life is outstanding  I charged it only once till now  except   This band record heartbeat even when I do not use the band  do not know why   I usually do not use band in the night  when I wake up I see heartbeat readings    
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I unit cable charging and I unit   fitness  Accessories is not provide Missing part accesorios  I want to get video with inital packing and  I want to refund my product     It is decive and cheating of customer   
Smartdevices,2,CG,  I try to connect my phone it is not connected mi A  I try another phone it is connected after   or   attempts how people design user definitely take while choose product wisely
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought it as a gift for my sister s birthday  It was wrapped as a gift when I received it so I could not open it as soon as I received it  Later when existing battery went down  we realised that box does not have a charging cable inside  Return window was closed by then  Advise to check for charging cable as soon as you receive this product 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Today I was traveling by car and observed that this band is counting steps where as my legs were moving due to vibration in the car  Funny 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Guys you need to buy this product  Its so cool and it also good with accuracy  Its good to track gyn workout and all sorts of workouts you do  Its all been installed inside the watch 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Product look is good   sturdy   overall nice quality      Must improve accuracy and add spo  also   Overall good product for rest things   Mi fit app is good advantage for bands    sleep tracking is also good must improve in update  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Mi Smart Band    This Smart Band is very Helpful for Track Your Daily Activities and Keeps you fit  it is Heart Rate Monitor  Stress Monitoring and Sleep Tracking is Highly Accurate   and it is Battery Backup is Really Good 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Watch glass is so delicate that it breaks with little hard pressure and then is not replaceable  Service center team asks you to buy a new watch and does not replace the glass 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Mi fit app just does not sync  Terrible sync issues  Distance recording is inaccurate  So all the basic reliability is  Missing 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The accuracy of the step counter aka pedometer is way off  Very inaccurate to the point where it counted     steps for    steps 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  After    days of using i am totaly disappointed with this band  Sometimes steps are not counting and not accurate  Some time Bluetooth connectivity issue  I have done a factory reset but still facing same issue  Never going to recommend this to anyone  I feel like lost my money  My replacement period is over 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is a good product and very easy to use and connected to my phone very easily  Would recommend it and the battery life is    days while being connected to my phone all the time and using all the features 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Why do we buy a fitness tracker  To measure exercises and calories burnt right  This Mi Band   is not good at all in it  It measures correct step count  But calories count is not correct at all  Most irritating thing is that it tracks steps even when you are riding motorbike or car 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Bought on    Oct      for      Rs    very good product  Sturdy and neat  does not look cheap as some people said  Quiet Accurate  Hope the band   comes with a thermometer and a SpO  features with a reasonable price 
Smartdevices,1,CG,    band    band    Heart Rate check     band    body touch   heart rate measure   LOL   How did it measure my heart rate    mi band      condition   no measurements      Mi band    Activity Tracker   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  It looks great   It provides facilities to track yoga also   The application  MI Fit  also works very well  It allows to add photos in display It provides good battery backup when compared to Honor band   Font is too small to read 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Yeah  better than mi band    All mentioned features are working fine  Worth waiting and purchasing  It also measure stress which is surprising and also do not know how much it is accurate  Overall best smart band at this price 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  There is not much change from its predecessor    Almost same   But it is functions are always good as old  In conclusion it is worth it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  First things first if you are mi band   user I strongly recommend you not to buy this product but upgrade from mi band   is worth it if you use the watch at its max capacity ie use the continuous hart rate monitoring and etc but if you want it just to see the time and count steps then you should stick to mi band  For me it is good and gets the job done
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Over all performance Is good and satisfactory to the price tag Display is awesome Only concern is the screen is not scratch proof  I bought the band for    days back and screen is so delicate and my band screen cracked 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Ordered a brand new product however not get original product  box sealed was open and accessories and warranty card is missing Not expected from the amazon for such experience 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Sleep tracking does not work for me   not even once   only a pedometr
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good fitness band  but not so much good   boat smartwatch is also with same price and also offers a larger display and exactly the same features  I recommend you to buy boat smartwatch as they are next level 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Seems everything that the makers claim this band can do is a big lie  Poor quality of activity tracking only adds up to your frustration of buying a bad product Save yourself from this frustration and do not buy this stuff  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good smart band     I have tested the accuracy of heart rate and steps counter  accuracy is       or    average  good brightness  and touch response is good and vibration feed back is super super watch faces and customizable   and that mag charge is awesome holding very strong mi fit app is simple and sleek go for it
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am not happy at all with this band  Sleep data is not showing  Skipping rope and yoga data is not updated in the app  Sometimes steps data becomes zero  After calling several times to MI call center they said me to visit MI service center  But MI service center kept the band and said me to wait for    days  Then they will get back to me  Disappointed 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good looks  The step count varies a lot compared to Google fit app  The counts synced from this to fit are always shown around        less in Google fit  Not sure why this is so  Since I use Google fit to track data and sync with other apps  the accuracy of steps from MI band raises doubts 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  excellent functionality  accuracy is pretty good too  many colorful faces available for the watch  but price could be better
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I really like the watch  in fact it has became my only smart watch  Really comfortable to wear all day  Battery last for   days at least with normal use  charges up quickly  I just hope the app would incrementally become better 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  As average product bcz you only get   inch screen after spending      only one thing is matter they offered you AmOled display
Smartdevices,3,OR,  First of all the package is damaged and my complaint to Amazon is their delivery its the  worst ever   Coming to band the display is small for me because I have used realme watchNext the build quality its awesome The battery is okIts looking is like         local bands Overall want to buy a fitness band in      you can buy this
Smartdevices,5,CG,  bigger screen size as compared to mi smart band   and magnetic attaching charger is really a good upgrade      amazing watch faces overall a great smart band to buy at such low cost go for it   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Third class watch  does not work proper i am using this watch last   days but does not display sleeping data  waste of money 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is awsome fitness tracker  With lots of useful features 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Review after    days of watch usage   Battery life is an amazing in mi band series  So hardly     each day even using continous heart rate monitering  And contionus stress checking    App is not best but better  no password setting compared to preceder  unlimited watch faces 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  did not like product at all 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Have to correctly place band for correct heart rate measurements to be recorded sometimes it shows i have    heart beats per minute in middle of a tense situation because i switched band strap that morning and position is off slightly
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very bad experience with the smart watch  I text used product the band was on mode and showing last   week history This band support only Mi fit software  So many issues to handle the app Overall I am not happy to see it wear it and used it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  There is only one downside to the given app  The jump rope reading is faulty  If I jump     skips  then it shows double the amount  Otherwise  the product and the app is excellent    
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The display started discoloration after   th day  Amazon s customer service says that the return window closes on the   th day Not happy with Amazon s response that I have to go to the mi service Centreto claim warranty for a product that I bought less than two weeks ago STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  okay goo for it    Okay for it is price segment    can not guess about durability     For more information mail me I will reply about it  vjkingmaker    gmail com 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  If ypu have MI band   do not buy this and if you are purchasing any band first time then go for it   Lookwise similar to Mi Band     Screen size is little bit increased   Some features increased   Battery backup is bad   One more upgrade charger is now magnetic  which is very good feature 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Jump rope values are showing in watch when doing exercise but not showing in app  This band just pushes the step count to mobile app  Distance is showing in correct   For example       steps showing as     meters in phone  Waste of money
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This band is just improving over each generation  This being the fifth is the most refined of all  Watch faces are so cool  Only missing item is spO  tracking 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Dislike  I was used approx   month while I am traveling in bike the steps already consider or increase also the same process on bus traveling that is was too worst  positive  battary was good charging was good strap was soft as compared mi band      
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good and light weight with lot of watch faces
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is my first fitness brand to test many features  I am having an accurate tracking so far  and i have paired it with Iphone  This works well
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is amazing I loved this watch I have this thing that yes I have invested my money  in the perfect place I loved this watch I am in love with this watch 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is nice  heart rate monitor  sleep tracker and other functions but the main issue is with the battery life  charged it to      and it lasted only  days   Also the steps counter is very inaccurate  when i get up in the morning and get out of my bed it shows      steps before I actually take any steps 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I love it Mi has the best and affordable gadgets The band not only looks good but it work amazing  Sleep tracking is       accurate  it is other features are also good 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  What good is a fitness band if it cannot count the steps  This is still an issue with mi band   The step counter often does not work  Tried comparing the results with the ones provided on phone  and the results on phone are more accurate than from the band 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The glass  top layer  easily breaks and can not be replaced  even in authorised service center  So only buy if you will be able to safely protect it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice product  great accuracy  after  day used MI BAND   work well  light weight  specialy I like This Band to Monitor stress lable very very Fine   accurate  Heart rate monitor is work is working very Good  battary life is Good  but excellent in without sensing Mode 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Sleep tracker is good   however does not track walking properly  when I drive car  it counts the slight hand movement as walking   will not recommend
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I liked everything about this device  Performance is good and battery lasts long  It keeps you updated with all your physical activities  Go for it 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  is not accurate and even as I walk with my hands moving continuously  it pauses for a few seconds very often  Battery life is good 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good band i recommend you to buy it the experience is very smooth and the display is also very good  and mi fit app is very good and easy to use   The band provide very accurate data                _                                      
Smartdevices,5,OR,  New sealed pack  battery  backup is amazing  accuracy is above average  but ok for this price anyway mi product done its best
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have both bands  honor   and mi    but i really liked the honor band    it has higher accuracy in all functionality   ui is super smooth  display of honor is much brighter   mi   could have done better in display and accuracy   do not expect much  i already used mi band     that was great   but mi  did nothing much
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Product is quite good  Not satisfied with their calculation   I mean there is no accuracy in this band  And one more thing is company claim    days battery back   Bullshit  It die within    days  Not going to suggest any one to get this one at this cost 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I am purchasing  st time band watch I am giving feedback after using approximately   month  I am happy only that only one feature that is incoming call notification  Overall it is good product  If you r a stylish person than only purchase this product otherwise not  Thanks to Amazon and all of you who is help to delivered us 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Mi has removed spo  feature in Indian variant  but provided the same in Chinese variant  This is not done  Why this differentiation  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Sleep tracking is not accurate as well of you sleep early morning it is not measuring it  steps are Not accurate and my favorite battery life part is also not good with this band   It will work for only   days after full charge  I have not changed any setting 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Display is very good  pretty impressed with various tracking options  Would have felt less guilty buying it if it had not been a Chinese product  But frankly there was not alternative to this in the price range  Bought some local made idols for Dashera to compensate for the sin   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  All Who is Seeing my Review should buy this   sorry for bad englishAnd btw I am editing it i want to add something that the Packaging was too good it was not damaged from any side as i saw in many video that their packaging was not good it was damaged it was folded etc      you should buy it
Smartdevices,1,CG,  It counts steps while driving  sleep tracking is not effective  honor watch has better options and visuals The company advertised device with spo  monitor and sold in india without it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Such a great fitness band under     The band is very Accurate in every activity and the display is very good and brighte in even direct sunlight i am upgraded from mi band   to mi band   and the experience is very good you can go for it without any dout I bought this for       
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The processor of this product is too slow  its not working properly   foremost I bought Samsung galaxy fit   band that was amazing but due to unsupported with my iPhone I refunded that  this is a wrost product  do not buy it   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The Product is fine  Though It claims for about    Days of Battery life  You can expect around       days from Low to Moderate Usage The Heart Rate Sensor is okay okay  It can measure for say upto an accuracy level of     The Packaging from the Seller Appario Retail Pvt  Ltd  should have been better 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Distance walked is reflecting     of the actual Distance if not connected to location  Steps calculation is wrong  Also the quality of watch in terms of material used is average and charger quality is pathetic 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The heart rate monitor is total crap  While sprinting when I was breathing hard it shows a ridiculous heart rate of      If you are serious about any athletic training  forget this smart band  Its more of a casual wear
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Not sure what is wrong but the step counter stop counting on my second day off use  It happened right after I took it off for a minute or two and it put it on again  No amount of tightening the straps  uninstalling reinstalling the app  converting to factory settings or charging has helped me fix the issue 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  it is pretty accurate for the price but sometimes there seems to be connectivity issues but for the price range it is best in class 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   There is nothing to dislike for this product every thing is good in it  Amazon as expected good packaging and fast delivery  As everything has its pros and cons  This product does not have sp   feature which is compulsory needed in this situation  Moreover  the product is really nice 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  An amazing watch slightly bigger and heavier than the previous version mi band    It is also having more specs and also beautiful designs  Quality was great and also new spec PAI was brilliant you could track your sleep and heart rate continuously although it can damage the battery life it is better using it that way I think
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Actually I am writing this review after     months of using the band   and let me tell you this band is really good     every features in this band is excellent and accurate    great product to have at this price    it is also really durable which is an excellent attribute to have   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  the sleep monitoring is considered to be correct some what  but while driving too the number of steps are being calculated and showing more tha  k steps a day buy i m aware i walked less than      steps But value for money   the calls notifications  screen wallpaper change everything are grt 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Sleep tracking is almost accurate  battery life is ok  gives you    days usage on a full charge  Light weight  Heart monitoring is ok I would say  Does a good job for the price 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The camera pairing option does not work sometimes and when it does works the music pairing option doesnot work  May be it is only hapenning in my Realme X   Other options are working well 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Mostly have all the features that you expect in a band  battery life and display is more than good enoughHighly recommended on this price point
Smartdevices,3,CG,     Sleep tracking is excellent    Heart rate sensor is accurate    Battery performance  is too poor i e   Battery reduces from     to    just in    hours with continuous heart rate is ON and Sellp tracking and full usage 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  A budget smart band which contains almost all the features like heart rate monitoring  sleep tracking  etc      it is accuracy is around      Best budget band at affordable price  Thank you xiaomi for this amazing product  I hope this review may be useful to someone 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The accuracy is not so high  It tracks steps even while sleeping  it is sleep monitoring system is also not accurate  However the battery backup is good  User interface is also pretty much good 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Finest quality as compared to the last   editions of the MI band  Heart rate monitoring is quite a good feature and sensors are pretty accurate too Hardly any difference in the screen size just a minor increase from MI   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is been    days  since I bought it  No regrets  The battery lasts for   weeks  It continuesly monitors heart rate   I do not know about sleep monitoring  since I did not try it  It tracks everything accurately  The display has a good brightness range  Overall a good fitness band under  k 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The product that i received first were totally bad  the firmware had many bugs so i did a replacement  i got the replacement in  days and there were no charger with it  also the box of the band were damaged from the bottom so i returned the product very bad service by mi and amazon   did not expect this from your part 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  While doing workout I think its ok but not good  but sleep tracker and heart rate monitor is perfect
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Its a good band  For very light use battery is lasting for one month  Heart rate monitor working good  Stress meter I think it is working like a dummy  There is no use for it  Even we are driving or just hand shake steps are calculating without running or walking  Except these isuues band working fine 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Sleep tracking is spot on  it could use more sports modes  though one can track calorie burn using  freestyle    days actual battery life with all features enabled and heart rate monitoring at every minute Definite bang for buck 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Better if mobile app uses less battery  everything in mobile app is good but it uses around     of my charging daily and also connectivity is bad when my band and mobile s screen are both off my band will disconnect from my mobile again when i open mi fit app it will connect 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Superb work done by MIAdded one more band to my collectionHaving all models starting from first band
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   It is too good  It contain    types sports which is awesome also you can measure your stress level and breathing level too you can add you event too  The most fabulous thing is that we can pay through this and we can decline the can or ignore 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Actually I Was Pleasing To Buy MI Band     Then I Search For It   I Saw Mi Band     Ok  I Ordered It        Damnnn      it is Coooool Bro   it is AMOLED DisplayIt s AccuracyIt s Watch FacesAnd Finally it is Cool Features   I will Strongly Recommend To Buy It   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Everything is fine with this band   BUT THE PROBLEM IS INACCURATE STEP COUNT     WAY MORE INACCURATE THAN ACTUAL    that is why I asked for a replacement    And it is on the way     Once I receive the Band  I will check and edit the review as per results
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The watch has many new features just go for it
Smartdevices,5,OR,  It is the best band I have ever seen with best features    I got it in a good conditionThanks Amazon  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The sleep tracking is not accurate  you have to consider    to    min error in the readings Other than that it is a nice product if you are into fitness and calory count But for sleep tracking I will not suggest it  Also the day time nap reading are also inaccurate 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good overall but i felt the same results can be achieved with mi band    Only a few women specific features are there in mi band   which are just gimmicks and not really use full in real world  I would suggest to go for mi band   and save a few bucks 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It used to be     accurate for first   months  After that it is a piece of brick  It counts         mtrs as   km while running  it is useless  do not go for this product
Smartdevices,1,OR,  it is accuracy with the steps is so bad if you r do not take a single step n just hanging hands then it will count the steps by my experience it counts      extra steps per day n it is so bad  other features like sleep heart monitor  workout mode are also not accurate so do not buy it n save money
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Amazing product  Battery once fully charged lasts upto more than a week It has a special feature to track the various kinds of workouts one does  like walking  running  cycling  aerobics etc   It even tracks your breathing and stress levels  Loving the product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I did not like the product as it was not comfortable wearing for a long time  It caused redness on my hand wearing it for a long time  I thought to return the product and get back my refund but not at all satisfied with Amazon s Return policy  I do not recommend buying from Amazon Thanks
Smartdevices,4,OR,  As you can already know that it is not that accurate figures which it gives they are slightly off but not bad screen is good ton of customisation battery is not good if you keep track of all and finally it has no spO  which is a huge bummer   else the watch is good and very affordable       
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Battery is draining like anything and too rapidly     loss in   hours this is not acceptable  This drainage of battery is observed after turning off all the features of band even the raise wrist wake feature there is something fishy with these bands  Many users around me have been reporting the same problem throughout 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Accuracy is good  strap quality is excellent weight around    to    gm   Good application  strap holes get bigger due to regular use sometimes while playing cricket pin comes out of hole and falls recommend you to buy buckle strap   days battery life after oning all feature s
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Heart rate monitor and sleep monitor works fine but not sure what is the issue with stress level monitor    It logs the stress level once in a while not logged continuesly  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent product has more features than one can use  The only flip side is that it does not have a screen lock
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Good band no compromise on quality  Display full of colours  Brightness very good no issue  in outdoors  Battery backup good last upto     days easily without continuous heart rate monitor  And a biggest advantage is that magnetic charger quite convenient on band   overall a best smart device for daily neend 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best fitness band from mi Heart monitor accurateSleep track could be betterQuality r awsmm Battery backup    Days mine  In one charge   Overall best     Fitness under     I got      in Diwali sale     Thank you      
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Accuracy is great but the weight is still the same    the band fitting is not comfortable
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Battery life is lesser compared to band   automatically scanning heart rate even the option is turned off 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   it is look pretty   compare to mi band     screen extra improved heart rate sensor newly add some extra features   overall  k it is Good deal
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Mi Band   is very good product new systamatic real time hart rate monitoring and new fits and health features and added to this new device it is amazing  everybody can by it
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am using it for almost   months  it is a nice product and value for money Though some of the features are not working like notifications and music with my MI phone But it is serving what it is paid for i  e  Step counting  sleep tracking and  calorie counting  roughly 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Keeps getting disconnected from the phone need to pair please provide and update to fix the problem
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The ocean of custom watch faces alone is enough to satisfy you for this price considering none of the rivals offer the diversity  Added to that is the accurate sleep tracking and REM monitoring  The app of course deserves special mention which too is way ahead of the competition 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have returned it  Because the band quality is quite degraded in comparison to Mi band   and    If you want to buy go for Mi Band    
Smartdevices,4,OR,  After   month of usage I am sharing my review  It is very useful although the strap caused me a little irritation in the skin due to sweat   Therefore initially I kept changing the position of wearing the band now it is fine  Maybe my skin got used to it I personally liked the product 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is like a latest tech and most compatible band for ios  Everything working just like android  Just go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  THE MI BAND   IS VERY MUCH COOL     IT TRACKS VERY FELL     IN THAT I LIKED IS PAI AND CYCLING      IT CALCULATES THE EXTACT LOCATION AND GIVE US      A MUST BUY BAND   FOR EVERYONE     THANK you MI BAND          AND IT HAS WORLD CLOCK AND MANY MUCH IN DETAILED FEATURES     
Smartdevices,1,OR,  does not connect to my phone very well  Even a swing of my arm would count as a step  Not accurate at all 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It worked fine But now it is having trouble in locating GPS signal more often than once or twice in a day   which makes the intention of workouts some what less stringy    Anyway water resistant feature is very well justified 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  do not buy it very small screen plus all tracking and everything is highly inaccurate not worth it go with honor band or buy smart watch Not comfortable at all band quality very poor compared to mi band   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Step count  sleep count are accurate  Calorie count and bpm is not correct  Build quality is good  App needs to be improved 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Not much different from the mi band   But it offers more accuracy  Probably the best fitness tracker at this price range  Although  I have to mention the mi fit app is utterly garbage town 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Its getting paused every now and then between workout    specially while running and walking    Its getting started on its own but irritates a lot   
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I got a budget mi Band   to explore the life in a way of healthy routine to check my Sleep   monitoring all day to day activities  Awesome amoled display Very comfortable to wear Nice stress monitoring Long lasting battery power Gud magnetic charging
Smartdevices,5,CG,  total value for money  The only thing missing is always on display  The Amoled screen is absolutely brilliant  band is indeed light as feather  Amazing battery life     days  heart beat   calorie count matches exactly with my garmin and apple
Smartdevices,5,CG,   All fitness trackers are inaccurate   Greg Doucette  I mainly use it as a timer for gym sets  notifier for apps  gene wake up alarm and sleep tracking  it is awesome  really love the amoled display  Very light weight 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Thanks amazon for delivery in   day  it is working properly  I am using from last    days  Recharged is required on   th day   But manufacture commits for    days 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  It shows severely mis accurate steps  It does not have gyroscope that allows for accurate motion sensing that can determine whether you are walking or not  I was really disappointed with this since it was my main focus  Other than that i do not have any problem with the watch 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Device is good very much compatible with phone Interesting part is customizable screens Battery backup is good as mentioned Good  charger easy to charge I am Satisfied customer 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  First I was going for noise smart watch  but after buying this MI Smart Band   I feel better that I did not buyed another watch    It have better improved than MI Band    Good Smart Band  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  It is one of the best smart band launched in recent times  Easily paired with my iPhone     Auto detect activities  Heart rate and stress measuring features are just awesome  Whatsapp  Instagram  Facebook notifications are easy to check  Vibrates on call  message and notifications  It is worth buying 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Battery backup is not good  
Smartdevices,2,CG,  I do not know what is wrong with this watch  I charged it yesterday to      and after even some days the battery is not draining even    this is the major problem with this band 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The Xioami Band   Is A Band With A Concepts Of Ideas Of It   It Has Many Useful Features Like Fitness Tracking   A Number Of Watch Faces And Many More   As Compared To Xioami Band     It Is Wonderful And Fantastic  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Highly inaccurate heart rate monitoring  Best avoided if this is the primary reason for purchase Sleep tracking and distance   step tracking is fairly accurate 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  it is been   week since i bought this I am not satisfied with the outcome it is itching my skin My skin got rashes Heart rate is also not accurate I want to return this product as it is not suitable for my skin but there is no option to return it   Totally disappointed 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Hi went to the Mi store in Bandra and was told that it is a fake defected piece and Mi    I would request you to please change a new Mi Smart Band   or refund as soon as possible  This item was bought for my Son as a gift for Children s Day  Amozan you will have disappointed me
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Really l love to wear this    Good for all day wear does not hurt my wrists   sleep tracking  stress tracking    Resting heart rate BPMs are accurate but Activity based BPMs are not that very accurate    Call attending facility is missing    Hope Xiaomi fixes it next time   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good product from mi with colour display  However  while driving vehicle in low speed in traffic  it counts as footsteps 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  It is really nice in tracking a lot of info that did not have in the first place Sleep tracking works     fine at fine  Not sure about sleep tracking during day time The app is relly flexible and can change a lot things   The display and built quality is great 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Really amazing product It is easy to use and it has add on features such as stress tracker and REM analysis which gives much more value addition for the given price
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Like very much  working perfectly Battery life almost    to    days  it depends upon our use  Easy to charge with magnetic charging cord 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Display     Touch   control     Connectivity       Bluetooth range      Activities tracking       Battery         days battery backup when all functions are on  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  do not expect a smart watch from this device this is an fitness band   accuracy in all categories is pretty good if you love to do exercise and going park n gym you should definitely go for it   heart meter is not up to mark sometime fails but hey do not expect much and try if you love   
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Only Cons which I felt  Step count is actibated even when you are on bike or car  Yesterday I completed      steps in car itself   Battery life is not much ok when you activate continue heart rate   Spo  I am still expecting after update 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Stress monitoring more often could not measure reading  Seems not functioning properly
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Was working good at first  but later when I was using it during my workout in workout modes  I left a shock while touching metal objects  which was shocking due to this I want to replace this item but the replace time was over itseems  not expected this from MI
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good product but if oxygen saturation is added it would be much better Also number of steps accuracy needs to be improved 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Mi Band                     
Smartdevices,5,CG,  My order came on    october On that day I fully charged this  And on this day  I charged it for the  nd time  It has a great battery life  Everything s good only the gps while cycling was not that accurate  And please give options for band colour  A must buy for people who love physical activities
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good value for money  PAI feature is not there evev in the latest Apple watch  PAI score rating have changed the way I jog n walk for the better  Thank you 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The product is just muaah Just loved it
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I am fully happy and satisfied with its accurate functioning   The deal is Value for Money 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very good product  I was using fastrack band for last four years  But this is best 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Everything is well  but this band count step when you traveling on bike or car  so you can not use it     Other features are very good  battery life  sleep tracking also awesome  But due to step counting while traveling on bike or car how can you do correct analysis of your report
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Quality of this band hi too great     It feels on wrist like no object lie on too light weight     Greate job by mi
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is great and accurate   had a few problems with pairing as it kept disconnecting from the phone every   seconds but now it is working ok  if anyone knows how to fix the connecting problem plz do let me know otherwise happy
Smartdevices,5,CG,  It is just Amazing at this price range it has mostly all features which are needed in a fitness watch apart from that it has customize background in which we can pick any pic from gallery and keep it as our display this option is available when you download Mi fit app Loved it   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Watch was superb and durable also and it got fall many time but no scratches are there but there was a small problem that I do not get all wallpaper as compare to other watches as in my friend phone there was too many wallpaper but in my there is less   what to do about this some one please tell 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  NOt at all accurate
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Tracking of daily steps  workouts and heatbeatsGraphical reports Music and call control without smartphoneFeatures worth of money spent on product 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am confused between  boAt storm watch and mi band   but at last i am selected mi band   that  are really impressive  really  i give this one   Star rating 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Again like mi band  Strap is not comfortableAnd performance is not good regret to waste     
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This fitness band is the value for money awesome features
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Waste band   better
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am a mi band   user  I have upgraded to mi band    it is awesome and all the features are fantastic Packing excellent Mi band   excellent Quality top notch in this segment 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Love the product  True value for money  However  it needs to be shipped with tempered glass or screen guard for protection of the screen  Overall  I am loving it 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Step tracking is running even you seat in vehicle and heart rate also measure when you do not wear it  Totally wastage of money 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This band is doing an excellent job  The calculated HR value is mostly reliable and the battery life is excellent  One drawback is that sleep monitoring is ineffective  However  this band provides better value for money 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is really fabulous in that price range it is super cool all are working fine do not expect apple watch accuracy range it is good in that price range  no other brands can beat this if you are looking for low budget take this band 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  A good product  reviewing it after a month  Not a single issue at all  Charger is more durable than all other mi band chargers  Once fully charged  lasts a week   if all features are on  lasts upto     days  I am very satisfied and recommend you to buy MI Band   too 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Its best smart band in the market and lot of features and best battery life  The Mi app is very good and comes with lot of customisation
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Not accurate step counting
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent band better than mi band  The band is very comfortable and very stylish The magnetic charging is also very good and the magnet is very powerful overall Excellent product
Smartdevices,2,CG,    hrs sleep monitoring is fake   it can not recognise day time sleep dataWhen you turn on PAI in the band  you can lose ur      charge just in  daysWe need to charge it daily     And it not get a perfect distance calculate during workouts   I just given  star for brand value

Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is good except lift to wake  Lift to wake is too sensitive even i set it to normal in the app  Every time i am using the clutch in the bike it turns ON  Every time i washing my hands it turns ON  Kindly check whether it can resolve through update  It turning ON unnecessarily 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  This band has very low accuracy rate  Whether it be outdoor walk or indoor treadmill run the stats data is poorly measured  I know this band can not be compared with iWatch but the data which it displays is of no use if it is not accurate 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I have been using since    days as of now no issues Battery backup is excellent    days   for meFast chargingOther trackers like walking  cycling  sleeping is goodCustomised screen share is goodOverall it is a good budget purchase
Smartdevices,3,CG,  More conveninent and better than previous version but battery life not much that mi brag and also why they say they launching in   different color straps only get option of black  I was interested in buying teal but only option black  Also disappointed by made in china  mi be vocal for local 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Master in accuracy and precision  Sleep tracking is also accurate  App experience is smooth and user friendly  Packed with many features  Useful for fitness minded people  Very comfort and skin friendly  Display is smooth colorful and attractive      
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Most accurate   good battery backup  Wonderful   star product  Apart from that The strap material gives me itching after long days of usage  The rubber material is causing skin allergy 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Sleep tracking feature is amazing  Shows your deep sleep and REM sleep timings and data  combined with stress and heart rate markers  All activity trackers like step count  calories  etc are ofcourse there as well 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good feel while using it but they need to give proper instruction  train to use it to best  App does not support you properly
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I am using it from   days  It works nice for app notifications  And themes are really good  Sensors are working fine but not great  Sleep monitor is not good  And battery life is   days with full brighthness and on complete installation  But good product in this pirce range 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Most important thing in smart band is not in accuracy  It is in consistent This gives consistent results  Value for money  PAI SCORE really motivates It does the job
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Best fitness band within        there is PAI STATUS HEARTRATE  NOTIFICATION STRESS  BREATHING EVENTS WEATHER WORKOUT MORE and CYCLE i was thinking to buy mi band   in flipkart but when I see mi band   in Amazon prime I purchased it immediately thanx Amazon for this amazing product
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Step tracker is not so accurate  Was fine initially but now shows nearly        lessGood battery life  Almost goes on for     weeks with no heavy usageUsed while doing cycling n it keeps getting disconnected from app n needs to be restored every       mins 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very bright display  great outdoor visibility  All the functions work well  I have not found any bugs  Heart rate monitor is very accurate Magnetic charger is also very convenient No scratches found  after one month of use 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The downside sensor is protruding which causes pain if you wear it for long time Battery life is    daysAccuracy is good
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Best xiaomi mi band   is best its look is premium and the starp is very soft but some features like spo   nfc   and voice assistant was Missing that was in the Chinese and global version why mi you not provide them in the indian version highly disappointed about it

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Product is good  Received today   Yet to check the battery life   Watch face options are available  Heart  rate monitor  stress monitor etc  Good one
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Battery is just pathetic  does not give backup for a week also  Worst mistake of purchasing this useless product  Mi band   is still best with high vibration and good battery life 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good Product Stress is a constant in our lives these days and that is exactly where the latest Mi Band   helps  sort of   The new health band  launched by Xiaomi at a price point of Rs        is capable of monitoring your stress levels at a time

Smartdevices,4,OR,  Sleep tracking works fine it even tracks my naps during the daytime  battery life is approximately     days in full fledge use    Few software updates and it would be the best band to buy at this price       
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Not satisfied with the shipping qualityIt was not bubble wrapped  had two scratches on  the screen watch was already switched on and the orginal box looked tampered 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  If you are traveling in metro or driving it counts steps and stress meter do not works always but call notification is good for daily use Screen is goodIf you are thinking to buy it for fitness do not buy it If you are addicted to phone you can buy it 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  This product is useless do not buy for fitness it is absolutely in accurate like I bought the product for step counting it is ridiculous the steps are counting wrong and there is no way you can use it correctly and even Amazon is not helping
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice product I am impressed with its battery life it easily lasts more than   weeks nice screen brightness

Smartdevices,1,CG,  I received a used one despite or paying for a new one  With no user Manual and a broken seal  The charger was connected to the device when I opened the box  By Far not a very good experience 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Connection  and heart rate sensor problem  Heart rate reading give inaccurate result  Even measure heartrate give             without putting on my wrist and also while charging the band  How is it possible  This is the most big problem for me 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is great   Good improvements over its predecessor  But it is battery life is not upto the mark  Battery is only disappointment for me in band

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very helpful and the sleeping tracker is amazing  Mi fit band   is an amazing wrist band in this price  So good 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Best ever Band in this price range  Best part is that charging can be done without opening

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Its better then    face watch working super  belt also very comfort  easy to charge then   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  such a great product i blessed i got in in first sale  so loving it you can customise every thing take it without any doubt you will not regret it felt comfortable in hands and vibration when notification come  is so felt good
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I bought   after watching this I returned    They refused to accept a return but fortunately refunded   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Super    I am impressed    Best one    it is done all calculation
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Well it is a very good fitness tracker but I did not see any nfc and sp   in it Even if you want to get all features of band then the battery will drain faster
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice band with good smart features which help you to keep a better track of your health and work accordingly to improve it day by day 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Bought   of them  one for each in the family and its great  Bang for the buck 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I received a faulty band   its heart rate reading used to go from     to    in a sec  and i ordery a replacement  And the one I received did not even connect to the app  had to return that as well  The staff at Amazon sends you faulty products in replacement
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is amazing product  fits well on hands  I bought it for my wife it is mostly suits on women s hands  it is light weight and mostly accurate  Most favourite is its screen it is bright display is just too good 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Must buy   it is budget friendly plus it gives accurate results of sleeping  walking and heartbeat activity  Battery life is also satisfactory    Still     after   days of continues usage  Overall I am happy with this product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Not accurace
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I received this Mi Band   by today at        And I found Touch Screen not working  I found this same issue with also my brother s Mi Band   which he received yesterday  This is super annoying  Xiaomi please fix this kind of Issues  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Used item delivered  seal broken 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Has most of the functions that one would require in a fit band  At this price its an excellent product 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I am using mi bands for the first time but definitely the price and the features they are providing are worth it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I liked it very much personally  only SPO  is missing  It would me more better they would have added that feature
Smartdevices,5,CG,  High quality display loved it   Best smartband in budget while comparing with others mi band   has better display and does not feel like square display like others
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Overall looks is very nice  Display is mind blowing  Battery service is tremendous  Equipped with lots of features  Magnetic charging is very unique  Love this mi band     
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Insanely inaccurate steps count  Moving the wrist does not switch on the display  We have to touch the screen to see the time which is very bad  Also I got mail from Amazon at     am to write a product review  Kindly care about our  sleep Alexa 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The tracking of steps and sleep are not accurate  Battery life is not too good  lasts for only   to    days with minimal usage 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The battery life on this new Mi   band barely last for a week and not as they claim it to last for   weeks on a single charge 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  it is not about the product but it is about service  I ordered it for my brother as a surprise gift but he did not like it for the look and now I do not even have a choice to return it so it should be rightly mentioned that you can not return it once you purchased
Smartdevices,5,OR,  If you are in a search for a fitness band  then this is the best one         Comparing it with the mi band    it is more better bcoz there are many new features in it such as the camera n paiapp
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This review is after    days of purchasing the product  The battery does not even last for     days these days  I do not know if I am the only one facing this issue  Feeling really bad 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Smooth touch control Good battery backup Strap is fine Only camera opening function is not working properly  You have to open camera first then it clicks a picture Sometimes music control does not work However in this price segment it is the best 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The best budget tracker currently available  Using it since   weeks  worth it Also coming from the mi band    It felt a huge jump  Not recommended if you have the mi band   or similar alternatives already 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Best band under     Superb build quality Having all the features that a band should have with good aquracy It also have some other good features which are also nice Good display and brightness and battey backup is also very good 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I really like the band and recommend  to buy this product but I am not quite impressed with the battery life of the band but this is a nice product  Quality of the strap and band is very nice nice work
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I have been noticing since   week that my steps tracking is not accurate 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Steps count is not working correct this is critical bug of this product Alert for long time sitting also not accurate Overall just ok 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I dislike its battary backup   in product info its showing   days battery backup but its giving only     days backup   other tracking is not so accurate   only step tracker works properly  I recommend not to buy it   if you want accurate tracking device 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  One of the finest fitness gadgets available  probably the only missing feature is the SPO    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Exellent band     nice touch n features       at this price just go for it
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Everything is goodI gv  star   I ll gv it  star if it has SPO   NFC   voice assistant
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This band has everything you can imagine  its faces are next level awesome and I had been waiting for this since Jan  this is by far the favourite watch I have ever owned 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very very very poor battery backup So much disappointed by this productThis product should be under    This product is not VFMBattery does not last for   week   I do not connect my phone   just  Normal use

Smartdevices,4,OR,  Sleep tracking is a bit off as if shows extra hours of sleep  Overall it is a good basic watch to track steps
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The band gets paused automatically during the workout  The step tracker is inaccurate  It is capturing distance as   km and steps as       The pace of walking is captured as    I am not sure if any human can walk at that pace and even cover  km in just    k steps

Smartdevices,3,OR,  It is pretty Good Tracker It loses it is   star for not having SPO  monitor  which must be a key feature for current situation  And   Star for having a little high price which is not a big deal  But it affects some middle class budgets 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Accuracy is pretty good as compared to apple watch though it is cheaper battery lasts for   days when continuos monitoring and everything is on sleep tracking is more than     accurate 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  magnetic charging a plus  but battery life is less compared to Mi fit

Smartdevices,4,CG,  The distance calculation is way off mark   Battery life is good   Lasts more than a week 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Overall band Is Awesome but can not be used fro sleep tracking and calorie burn accuracy  the accuracy  is nearly       But battry life   hearbeat and some other features like photo as band wallpaper are awesome

Smartdevices,1,CG,  Sleep tracking  steps counting are pathetic    My mi band   was more accurate than this crap I was very excited for this but it disappointed me  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Inaccurate data measurements  Even having a desk job it reads that I have covered more than      kms  Also  even after doing behavior tagging it does not improvise itself  Replaced one band  yet the other one reads the same data

Smartdevices,4,CG,  I am satisfied with this smart band  But sleep tracking features will require lot s of improvement for this band

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good product and is accurate and the battery backup is good 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  bpm  indicate is  not availablescreen touch  movement is very delay
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Completely satisfied with the build quality and the features the only thing forces me to give   star is the accuracy of step counting  The step goes on increasing even when i am sitting  So i hope they might fix this issue with the next firmware upgrade 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  After three days of use   it is very good to track sleep   but in footstep tracking accuracy is not good

Smartdevices,1,CG,  Nice band  Tracking is good  but mobile app need to improve  belt is low quality
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Lovely band ever  Accuracy is impressive  Perfect buy for ladies  Just go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good    but the product is a bit suspective because the battery percentage was quiet lowAnd it is battery does not discharge very quickly and lives more than written on details   It is very accurate and worth buying   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I think  it is the best fitness tracker in this price range  it is accuracy is not correct but it is better than any other fitness band in this sigments Some bugs are still available till now  Hope  it will be fixed by Xiaomi with new update 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I like it is screen quality though it is screen size is little smaller as it seem in the mi band There app ecosystem is not good they must have upgrade the app 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  When I have night shift and go to bed at morning   or    and sleeping for     hrs  device showing no sleep data  Sometimes it is showing a few hours nap    If you sleep before sunrise say around   am it is properly detecting sleep data

Smartdevices,4,CG,  All good except bit concern about battery life     compare band   and   battery life is less     but awesome magnetic charging cable smoothen charging experience    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Flawless and beautiful product  Upgraded and smarter one for lifestyle
Smartdevices,3,CG,  After one month i found it is ok product  Not soo good or not soo bad I remove my watch sometimes during sleeping still its sensor os calculating heart beat and stress  Biggest drawback should be comeover by firmfare update  Waiting
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I waited for   months for this one to get launched in India to buy it   Without any doubt this is the best budget friendly band   The features are brilliant   Worth the money   Just for for it   Cheers

Smartdevices,5,CG,  good band accurate heart rate moniter and durable peice
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Product is better at this price range when compared to similar products of various bands 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good product and features  Was using MI  earlier and this one is a superb upgrade 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have changed my routine of sleeping after using this watch and tracking of walking and exercise are the best use  Heart rate and stress measuring features are aslo commendable 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is good in this band but We cannot switch off the band  that is why I can not save battery  when it is not on my wrist 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Step counting is not correct at all  please update it by updating the software                           
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Steps count is worse    It shows      steps whereas another band of different Brand and Google Fit App shows      steps     Gave the the Band to service center for this issue by Jan    and yet to get refund
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice strap  Better than expectations  Fits well on the Fitbiit 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Ok after   days of use  i like the features   If you want a watch with bigger and more costumize then go for it   But only few things are not that accurate but yes its usable   Looks better and better waterproofing   Definately you can buy it  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Not as good as Mi  band  Sleep tracking is bad  usually starts tracking after       mins after sleeping  More features but lesser accuracy
Smartdevices,5,CG,  A very good product by  mi I recommend to by this instead of  mi band   bcoz with the difference of     rupees you are getting so many new features   
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Battery backup is not so good as they claimed Full recharge battery runs up to   days Workout tracking accuracy is good Look wise its fine But one thing I faced while using it    is only the battery issue 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Excellent sleep tracking    cycling   Step count seems mis calculated Amoled display is great   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  good quality  comfortable to use  too many unnecessary functions
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   You could improve the battery life  And add a GPS to the watch l so that it does not need a phone all the time to do activities 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The product is  good but I am just disappointed with alarm   the alarm is not very strong it vibrates only for   to   seconds  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This is my first smartband and I had to say it is upto my expectations  Quality of the band feels premium  Once due to some issue my  km walk was not registered apart from this tracking seems pretty good 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I received the product within   working days I found product in a good condition and overall product is excellent Battery life is also good  more than    days battery backup I got 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I already used band    Now got band    This is awsome band very good battery backup  Accurate reading  Also it have more extra functions added as compared with band   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Its a very good band  App  Mi Fit  is very good  the tracking is not the best but ok  Overall its worth the price and you will not regret the purchase 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  A good product with all good optionsThe camera and music options are very useful   The accuracy is good and a great fit band   Must include the password system I feel         Overall a great band compared to three and four        
Smartdevices,3,CG,  it is good with new features but cons is the battery part they    days withstand but it doest even cover    days  I tested on heart rate without keeping on our body it show reading do not know how it is possible  sleep tracking is well good
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice product if you r serious about ur health   It atleast help in putting some efforts towards the first step on your fitness 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Performance is good    Look wise is also good      Main plus point here is Magnetic charging      I have some problem while connecting to my device OnePlus nord    Finally it got connected 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This watch is good i have fought one problem i e  it is not so accurate   but in this range i suggest you to buy this awsm watch it has good features it posses good battery life and it is look is simply awsm  Guys go for it     
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good value for money product with MI great service backed   
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is Good  do not change the Design as there is a separate catagory for watches  Band should be like Band only  Please add inbuilt GPS and SpO  sensor in coming versions of the Band to enhace the accuracy 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Accuracy is good in case of heart rate or stress and workout but pedometer is not counting the number of steps properlywhile walking rather counting the movement of hands and counting the steps while riding in any vehicle 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Gifted to my dad and brother They loved it    must buy product    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good product easy to use quality of product very nice     Band quality also nice

Smartdevices,5,OR,  Value for money and lot options available in app
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is having light weight compare to mi   have lot of options and one thing confusing is the PAI option other than that this thing is worth the money you purchase
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Recently upgraded from Smart band  th to  th version UI looks pretty cool  Automatically syncs via bluetooth  did not notice any lag in the notifications  Overall a really good product to have 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The product is fine and apart from that calorie burnt is not at all accurate and had much of discrepancy only thing that feels good is that steps are calculated perfectlt
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I liked everything about this band and one thing I dislike is they had told that the product will come at   pm so the problem is that the Amazon facility should stop deliverys after   because their areany people who sleep at   pm also
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Its awesome and worth buyingTracks all things perfectly and is more accurate than mi band    week Battery lifeFast chargingMobile app works perfectlyGo for it

Smartdevices,5,CG,  So far so great the display is beautiful and the tracking is okayish  Got it for Rs      after applying coupon and bank offer and it is great for the price 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Earlier  I used MI   band that measuring correct HR  With the intension that MI   is an advanced version  However  measurement is misleafing  I want to change this product  Help me in this matter 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am not at all impressed with accuracy  Battery drain very quick  I usually charges twice a day  Overall I am not prefer to this product to buy  So  please go for a quality products  not to this

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Band working is good but strap was got skin rashes    So I recommend to this just ok    
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Great buy The only con i found was the quality and lenght of the magnetic charging cable 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome

Smartdevices,1,OR,  It is good but not expected as it is price valueI suggest you to do not buy this instead you can buy realme band worth Rs      
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using this watch for the past    days good battery backup    sleep tracking is really awesome     Worth for the price    heartbeat sensor is nearly exactly reading but stress monitor needed to be update

Smartdevices,5,OR,  But no SPO 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Your activity does not automatically sync with the mobile app   Solution is everyday you need to open the mobile app to sync your activity data to your phone  So you can not monitor previous data 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Great light band  clear visibility even in sunlight  steps count  sleep tracker seems accurate  the only problem is while its connection with phone for gps is a bit erratic sometimes  get cut off abruptly
Smartdevices,5,CG,  not much accurate for heart rate and foot counts i am not walking but still keep counting my counts

Smartdevices,1,CG,  It is good but I think  Its heart rate is not accurate because when I am not wearing it then also it shows my heart rate
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The band is extremely good  I liked the features as well 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Accuracy high for sleeping and tracking and band much smart it determine that you are walking or sleeping or running or physical exercise according to your work  it will track you I give it       
Smartdevices,1,CG,  THERE IS AN SCRATCH ON THE DISPLAY   I RECOGNISED IT AFTER    DAYS   BUT AMZON CUSTOMER CARE DIN T HELP ME THROUGH   ALSO I VISITED MI STORE THERE ALSO NO USE   TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED

Smartdevices,1,OR,  Disconnected in short  distance after every    sec  I do not like at all the product  my money  was wasted

Smartdevices,4,CG,  Battery is not good  Its charge fast is just take  hr   min to full charge   Display quality    out of     All mode is good but not accurate  Based on    days of uses  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  if you want for show then its okay but in terms of tracking without GPS this band falls short in every way way Better use your phone as a pedometer 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  My first MI product  More than just a cheap Chinese item  The Company has worked a lot on improving the accuracy of all the features  Value for money too 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This product  is not worth   Does not show accurate readings of   heart rateStreesBreathingIt do support vibration but can be turned offIt takes time to get connected

Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best of step tracker   I have wasted money on two such products which I regret before buying this one    but its worth every penny abs battery life is amazing

Smartdevices,4,CG,  Battery life and accuracy are top notch for this product in this price range The only part I dislike is the mi app which does not work as I expected especially behaviourap tagging 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is accurate  But do not expect a battery life of   weeks if you want continuous heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking

Smartdevices,4,CG,  very comfortable to wear accuracy to measure heartbeat sleep tracking is ok Magnet charging is very convenient 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not buy this product as it is not accurate at all  I walked  km but it shows  km already so it will show calories accordingly  Waste of money

Smartdevices,4,CG,  Nice band but accuracy no properSleep tracking its okBattery life is very very very long time power backup     
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Inaccurate  Steps counting automatically stops  Keeps on pausing    Irritating

Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best band ever
Smartdevices,3,OR,  More excited to buy but after receiving the band not up to the mark as same as previous one no much changes in itCamera and music feature not working for my phone
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Very good watch faces  and the quality is also good  Screen is also responsive  But the heart rate sensor starts automatically 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Deep sleep data is always almost same
Smartdevices,3,OR,  It is not showing stress level  sleep history does not look like real and not matching with self assessment 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent band     Thank you amazon for   hours delivery  I like this smart band   very much    Excellent n worth for money
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The watch provided by first order was not so responsive but when I replaced it they gave me watch with damaged belt  So worst product I will not buy it again 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not go for it   It will automatically disconnect in every    minutes from your app and your data will be lost    It is highly flawed
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I ordered   Mi Smart bands out of which   piece was not working  After getting it checked in Mi store  it tuned out to be fake  did not expect this from Amazon 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I gifted my fiancee and she is very happy  Must buy product for ladies

Smartdevices,4,OR,  before i start to write a review for this product  let me thank to amazon to delivered me as he promised me before delivery date   overall great product by mi india   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Everything satisfy to the penny  the only draw back is brightness decrease automatically when the battery percentage reduces from          it be there when it is       
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Using for last   months  Overall good performance except limited watch faces and music control was poor    Accuracy getting average

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Budget friendly and nice band 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Useful
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Not worth it
Smartdevices,5,OR,  It is the best fitness band that mi has launched  Its activity tracking and sleep tracking is really awsome  The best fitness available at this cost  Everyone should try it once    
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Nice band loved it   but the thing I would like to mention here is that  if you turn on PAI  and all activities tracker it will drastically reduce battery life    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Value for the money

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Step count is little inaccurate but itna to chalta hai I upgraded from MI   to this one and I am a happy user
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Heart rating is not much accurate
Smartdevices,5,CG,  MI Smart Bands are always worth the price  The functioms  the modes and everything is just outstanding  Improved charging is one of the greatest advantage 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  always reading and showing heart rate without wearing watch it is new technology haa haa
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Should have spo  software   Otherwise a good purchase  Good battery backup GO for it

Smartdevices,4,OR,  Build quality good  as well as display and strap quality   and many more coustomize options on mi fit app  But bluetooth connectivity range is too short 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Git a used product The package was torn off  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  My fitness friend  Love all the features it offers  Love the notification feature mainly  Very accurate 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  battery life is    days and not    days as they said  sleep monitored only at night and not in day time 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great accuracy   also beneficial for those who want to know about his weight training calories or BPM rate     But battery backup is not too good

Smartdevices,1,OR,  what is Good    Large Screen for Band   Amoled Display   To   For Show Off BandWhats not Good    Accuracy Worst   Heart Rate Sensor   Even Detects For Non Living Things and also Detects If Not wearing the band Also     Not Suitable for Serious Fitness Guys   Bad Accuracy     Bad Strap Quality   Not suitable for Big Wrists     No useful feature in Real Life   Because of Bugs and Defective Sensors in the Watch  All The Features Like Stress Extra Fitness Modes Does not Give Accuracy in Readings Note   I Recommended this Band for Normal Purposes just like a watch   Smart Watch     And Not for Serious Fitness Tracking   Fitness Purposes 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Mi Bands  like other Xiaomi products  are beautifully advertised  Packed with features  they come at affordable prices too  I have used an older version of Mi Band and it became useless in four months  My friends who are using the newer versions have the same complaint SCRATCHES you will fall in love with your Mi Band at the first glance  However  within two weeks the console will start looking fuzzy as it accumulates new scratches every day  These scratches can be easily caused by anything from rubbing against bed covers to the insides of your trousers  pockets  So  you can never be enough careful In a couple of months  your beautiful Mi Band will look so ugly that you will begin to hate to even think of it  that is how most people do not bother coming here to write a review after a couple of months  use 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I m giving it   stars because i am in love love love with this band    it is my Very first fitness band and i am glad i took decision of buying it   it is completely worth every penny    The stress montior and sleep monitor option is amazing  i m unsure that it calculates accurate calorie but anyway   Although i bought this band directly from mi website   But just go for it  it is the best smart fitness band until mi band   is not releasing   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is a short review of the Mi Band    The things I like    The display  it is gorgeous  I was using the Mi band      and this upgrade makes a huge difference in terms of screen quality  resolution and brightness  This Mi band   is easily visible in direct sunlight  thanks to the     nits bright Amoled panel used    The charging mechanism  it is a night and day difference  and I am happy that Xiaomi has finally fixed that    The touchscreen  it is really smooth compared to the Mi band   Couple other things to be noted a  Tons of customization available in Mi band   watch face b  The screen is bigger now  so it is better for outdoor usage c  Fitness tracking is quite accurate  not upto the mark of Apple watch obviously d  Battery life is decent  not the best that I have seen  Expect s battery life of    to    days At last  if you have the budget of       just go for it  you will not regret 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Buying this brands band is just a waste of money  It is better to donate money to a needy instead of buying the band of this brand  The charger is worst ever produced charger  Guarantee is just of the watch and not of the charger so the charger is produced with the cheapest quality possible  It is completely fake that the band is water proof   moisture accumulates at the charging points and then too the poster is there that the band is water proof  No help by the company or employees is provided at the customer care centre  Even the band quality is so cheap that it breaks within six months  Never ever the band starts charging at once  So plz never buy MI s band  Plz go for different brands 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Loved the product for it is accurate measurements and display  Only con I felt is the mobile application s interface I would a bit of old school   It would have been better if it was given a bit of polishing for the controls Last but not the least  Amazon did an amazing quick delivery and gave me the best rates
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I gifted MI   Smart band to my father  He primarly uses it to track his steps  heart rate and general fitness activities According to him the steps counter is pretty accurate and the heart monitor is more or less on point too  The sleep tracker he is yet to fully explore  The battery life is not too bad  He has charged only once in the last   days  He really enjoys the band and feels it syncs well with his Android phone  A good quality fitness band for an affordable price tag  that motivates you to keep fit 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Best in the market  Accuracy is good  Good for those who loves to walk and exercise  as they can easily keep a track of these  Easy to handle  Water proof  Good in design
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The best band ever in       I am completely satisfied with the product  It is not that accurate  but is receives     accuracy  I highly recommend this product  If you want fitness tracker under      rupees  this band is recommended  A whole lot of features are included in this band  The stress level indicator and heart  rate are highly accurate  It has a strong magnet  If you hang the tracker  it is not going to fall  Conclusion   I fully recommend this band  It deserves full   stars
Smartdevices,4,OR,  What a band to have  It has a see through display which makes the screen transparent and a future tech at such a low price is a must  Very good display but the band itself is not much of an upgrade over mi band   as it does not have spo  sensor with ther version they are selling out of China  Also does not come with nfc  Only upgrade you will notice over band   is much better magnetic charger 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I got the fake product  The product which I got was  mi band   which was in the box of mi band    It was damaged or used or fake product  The packet seal was also open  There was no charger  Overall it was very disappointing  did not expect this from MI and Amazon  Worst experience ever    
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The interface feels small sized and text appears pixelated Not many faces in app and had to use third party apps That stress monitor is just a gimmick Battery life is about double than other bands available Strap is a bit unsecure Brightness is great Camera shutter option is what makes it different from others Otherwise great but priced somewhat more than it offers considering other bands available 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The overall look is nice but it does not have a enough big screen to operate it well  the main problem is it with screen   that is soo soo small   and the buckles are soo big  peraonally do not like it
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Screen is just gorgeous  it is full touch AMOLED display very impressive  Display is clearly visible under direct sunlight Strap is very good  it does not produce much sweat Battery back up Accuracy        Best for Gym lover  if interested gym  it is hard to find its screen guard plz available  st party screen guard  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Guys  please note  this product will not get returned  how ever its replaceable  Pl  take read all T C carefully before purchase  As i feel strap quality not up to the mark and proceeding for return then i come to know that it can not be returned  However  product overall is good
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Its the worst version of mi fitness band   It stops almost every next day  Need to reboot it again and again and again  Its my worst experience with mi  Forgot to take more screenshots of the same issue   will post more soon coz it will not improve   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I like this product very much  Very good battery I use this band normally and the battery backup is up to    to    days  The band is so nice and give accurate heart  rate This is big problem  But there is no spo  option  I also do water test of this band and the band pass water test even i dropp it into the water for   min         approximately  BUT ANYWAY NICE BAND 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Everything was good within warranty period only  After warranty period is over if the band have any problems then the there is no service for band  it is waste The service center guys will within warranty period if the band as any problems they will exchange or something will do  but period is over then it is waste no use So before buying please think about it
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good band with attractive display but the gift wrap is too worst  Actually It was not look like gift also  And the gift message is full spelling mistake  Completely disappointed with that Amazon has to examine about this  Mi product is always goodLove mi band
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is a brand new device  I afarid tat I might recieve a used product   The pacakging has two orgage seals at top and bottom  inside the box you can find the charge at first warped in a soft polythene bag  next you can find the device itself warped in a soft polythene bag

Smartdevices,4,CG,  The product is amazing  But when I opened it after two weeks of delivery  I was really disappointed  Some sort of ants have destroyed its very comfortable straps  I have not opened on the day of delivery as it was gift packed for my cousin  I might suggest to pack the product a bit more carefully and secure  Loved the product and its features  sleep tracking  menstrual tracking  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Straight to the point  Steps calculated according to your hands movements e g  If you would shake your hands it will count that as steps  Whenever I wake up in the morning band will already show    to    steps or sometimes more than that  While typing on computer it counts them as steps Battery life is pretty good  Gives me    days easily Sleep tracker is damn good 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have searched that in mi  oxymeter is there and I have ordered as a giftI got to know now there is no oxymeter feature on thisI felt cheated now it is more than replace n return time what do I do

Smartdevices,3,OR,  NOTE   There are thousands of reviews for this product  but surprisingly there is hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market   I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C   SI and Sennhesiers CX     so I would be comparing all these   earphones in this review   You get a   L   shaped connector in these earphones  so note that I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic BUILT QUALITY                     boAt   Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense  Metal housing holds up good  but colour sheds off after     months  Perfect  L  shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting  JBL    Small round cables  shredding off after     months of moderate usage  Plastic housing doing great so far Connector is bent  but not in perfect  L  shape  so its quite pain to use while resting  Sennheiser   Small round cables  holding up good after   year of rough use  Plastic housing has become slick  as rubber coating on it has shredded off  Perfect  L  shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting  WINNER  boAt     COMFORT               boAt   comfortable enough when used while in upright position  These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so  Has very long earphone head  JBL   Comfortable enough in upright position  Slightly uncomfortable using while resting  as these have offset opening  Sennheisers   Comfortable in both the position  These are apt for long duration usage  WINNER   sennheisers cx    LOUDNESS               CX      boAt       JBL CS   SI boAt   tends to distort above     level of volume  JBL   Crystal clear even at full volume  but has least sound level in all of three  Sennheisers   tends to distort above     level of volume  but has greater sound level of all   WINNER   sennheisers cx    SOUND QUALITY   Bass  mids   lows                                                 I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids   lows  which are strong   Crisp  But bass levels are different  boAt   has average bass  I am very disappointed with it  since these earphones are marketed as bassheads  JBL   has least bass of all  I felt treble is high in these  Sennheisers   ton of bass and when used proper eartips  its just a treat for bass lovers  WINNER   sennheisers cx    SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL                                     boAt   I noticed in early few months  quality over call was great  but started to deplete after     months  But its still good  not as good as new  Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side  JBL   its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now  Sennheisers   their NO microphone  lol  PNOTE  boAt   JBL both s mics works with android and iOS perfectly  WINNER   boAt     CUSTOMER CARE                       boAt     Year warranty  Had no issues till date  so did not got chance to check it  But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences  JBL     Year warranty  Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within   weeks after contacting nearest service center  Sennheisers     Years warranty  I had   of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half  was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center NOTE  I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service  I would suggest this to all  WINNER   sennheiser cx    CONNECTIVITY                    All the earphones have    mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices VERDICT            I do not think I need to explain anything else now  since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones  To sum up  I would say boAt     are good  if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies  If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting  then go for JBL CS   SI  But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me  then certainly go for Sennheisers cx    Hope this review helps you make sound decision 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I had purchased these boat headphones on may       Suddenly it has stopped working after just   months  It has a warrenty of   year  I want this product to be replaced as soon as possible  I need headphones badly  Such a bad experience with amazon as i have not done any major shopping yet on amazon  Just want this product to be replaced man 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought this earphone by friend suggest  I am using this earphone and have not faced any problems yet  Mostly I used headphone during traveling for listening music and watching videos  After two months of usage this headphone  I am giving review  I got the product well packed by Amazon  I ordered Neon Lime Color and Its a decent color  In packed box  got   pairs extra earbuds with different sizes  Sounds are amazing  Sounds are high with Extra Bass  but we can adjust  Sounds are much clear than others earphones I have ever used  No noises during calling  Length of the headphone is     meters  That is perfect for everyone  Wires are sturdy and strong  Jacks are metal and strong VerdictGuys go for it  Value for money  Its reasonable price 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It is a bloody DUPLICATE     The item was wrong in so many ways There are no Left Right indicators on the drivers   BASSHEADS  is written as  BRSSHRDS   the Jack is styled as the old Bassheads     and not like the new one  And items like ear extensions and extra earbuds are missing And the main thing  the item quality is too poor to be an original BASSHEADS earphone  Because I already have one  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Its been   months since i purchased this product  headphones were good at the beginning  i used the product very rarely and now when i plug it in my ears no audio plays on right and audio decreases and increases in left then I got a new one replaced as soon I posted complaint to official mail ID  The new one works perfectly well would like to thank boat for their Customer Sevice 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Sound is good   these earphone are good except one thing  the earphones are really very heavy and you cannot put it into your ears as it will fall down  That is the main reason that I have to return this product Not only me  I have seen my colleagues having the same issues so I would recommend not to buy thisOtherwise sound quality and bass is very good 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time Main drawback of this earphone is its weight  Due to metal body it weighs more which because it to fall from ear very often Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box Over all experience is very bad from one month  I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst I want to give   stars for this product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am writing review after one year  i had sennheiser cx     and i bought this coz it had  mic  i wil not compare this bad boat earphone as  right side  of earphone stopped working within   months  I sent to service center and replaced it  even that stopped working within   months   sennheiser cx     and it worked for almost  yrs years without any issues  now i have MI earphone with mic and it is working fine 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The product is just perfect for the price range  I have used sony and jbl before  but they lack some or the other features like sound quality noise cancellation and even the built quality  But this one just ticks all the boxes  You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under  k Pros Better Sound quality than it is competitorsBuilt quality is great  metal finish Better Noise cancellation than it is rivalsBass is just awesome  I am a fan of it Better pricing of all Cons Nothing as of now
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I will not suggest you  if you will buy this then you will be stuck and Amazon will not allow to return your poor machine I do not like this  The wire is heavy and feels like a cable   Also it is very heavy so does not fit in my ears it come out and hurting my ears  The very sad part is  I am trying to return it but amazon is not having return options only they can replace it where they are not understood customer prospects that of it does not fit to my requirements Nd not comfortable then what will I do with replacement  Very disappointed
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound  for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point But if you audiophile than this is not product for you  Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect  but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions I liked her like anything  but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me In short I am the king of bad luck in this Starting I do not like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions  But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life  but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion  may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life Considering my situation it will not be possible as I am already a settled manBut still I was hopeful  All the time I was thinking about her And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong Ahh the moment let me share with you guys  she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it is time say good night guys But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time  She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room   I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she did not even reply Whole night I will awake and very stressed Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me do not take any stressed go and back to you work She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life I know her past she was love in some man Who is more than  double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her  she behaved me I feel some time enforier  but anyway I am still in love with her Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I do not believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life  I am very good predictor May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times  please accept my deepest apologies And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome product  according to it is price bass is okay   sounds are good  vocal are ok  I ordered both boat rugged v  cabel and boat basshead      to be honest  it is very uncomfortable due to it is straight design  I have used sennhiser cx     which is far more comfortable than this  pouch which came along with it is also of great quality
Smartdevices,5,OR,  In short  it is awesome do not think twice before buying it In long Quality         Very high quality materials are used in it  Headphone jack is gold plated and the connector is very sturdy  Plastic quality is also great  Sound chamber is made out of metal  Wires do not get tangled  unlike some of it is competitors it also uses flat cables but unlike them it does not get tangled at all Durability        After using it   months continuously and meticulously  all I can see they are like tanks and are very sturdy in nature  Even after having few accidents with them they are more or less in pristine condition Audio  In this category it will score out of the boundary six  Noise cancelling and audio output of the headphones are boon for every audiophile Comparison  Between it and a Xiaomi Headphone  the difference is night and day  it is hands down a miles ahead of the Xiaomi 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Better than expected  Great Indian product  very clear and  bass is super  Due to high bass  peak volume makes more sound which can not be avoided in this type of earphones  Long quality cables  it is slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside  it is required for high bass earphones  that is the reason  ear hook is given along  Buttons and mic is good 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Previously I was using sennheiser earphones  For a change I bought this product  Overall I am happy and satisfied with this product in terms of sound quality bass quality and mic  It is definitely value for money I am not sure about reason but I feel uncomfortable while I use during running or walking or in sleeping posture may be cord is long and earbud designed in a way so sometimes difficult to adjust otherwise if you are in sitting posture  it is comfortable  I would rate       
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This earphone is not even worth Rs       I cannot believe all the rave reviews this product got   It has sub standard sound  no sound stage to speak of  a tinny muddied sound and bass is just an echo  All the frequencies are bunched up together  If Amazon would allow me to return it  I would have done it in a heart beat  Buy a Sennheiser of an MI Earphone 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros   _ Sound quality is decent  bass is upto the mark  _ Wire material is sturdy and strong  _ Non tangling earphone  _ You get extra earbuds   pairs   _ Earphone with microphone  has button for track change and pause play Cons   _ Overall the Earphone is a bit heavy  _ The wire seems to be longer than an Earphone should have  It sometimes gets stuck  I am a fairly tall guy and still I find it long  _ Not the most comfortable earphones  Earbuds do not properly adjust in ears  and the rubber hook or whatever it is called  leads to ear pain Edit  So due to the length of the wire  one day my earphone s wire did get stuck at a table corner and broke  The wire got detached from the microphone  Although I registered a complaint  and they picked up my product to get it repaired  and later called me to say that they do not repair it  They will just replace it if warranty conditions are fulfilled  So a      practically flushed down the toilet 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  this is not a worth product to try even due to following reasons      it is very bulky in nature for a ear in phone   the ear piece is not comfortable for a normal size ear   so feels very uncomfortable on the ear    the sound quality is just ok  and the other person may not hear you properly    there is no option to pick the call from the earphone  as no button is available on the earphonethere is one positive aspect also with these earphone that they are really rigid   so probably lasts long as compared to normal fragile ones 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  BUT   Been using these since      but they had earlier died within   months of use  Lucky the one year warranty helped me get them fixed  The company actually gave me a replacement as the left ear piece just would not work BUT   The earphones are HEAVY    This is because of the metallic body and the weight of the drivers of the earphones  So forget about wearing these in the gym or while running  They fall ALOT during vigorous activities Now let us get to the good part  The BASS   Omg is simply   Love  I could not believe the level of low end for the price and size of these earphone  The mids are good but the highs lack definition  which is alway the case with cheaper bass heavy earphones  However I purchased these with a purpose to watch movies   enjoy my bass heavy music  These were not bought to enjoy every track in high quality  When I am on the move I need heavy bass  loud volume  a quality microphone and reasonably decent audio clarity at an adorable price which this product delivers spoton  The cable is tangle free which is very handy For whenever I wish to evolve myself in high quality music  I plug in my Bose to enjoy the audiophile experience but the price points are very different to compare Conclusions   If you are some who watches alot of movies on the go  listen to the new trending music which is especially bass heavy and need a decent microphone for your phone call   Buy this with confidence If you found this review useful kindly hit the HELPFUL button below 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Considering the price the Bass is actually quite good Talking about treble its above average you will not need to worry if you are a bass lover  Mic is Good Enough   Build quality is just awesome as its having metal Casing and a durable enough flat cable  if cared properly  Comfortenes is where i feel it can be improved as its slips out sometimes because of its weighty body but it can be fixed using wings My email  ani  official gmail com
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have heard a lot about BoAt earphones and it sounds great  just like it is name  I was eagerly waiting for this  to experience how it is functionality actually will be  I got the  exact  neon lime colour earphone that I was expecting  Delivery was on time The packaging inside comprises of     neon lime colour and   black colour  earbuds of different sizes   one wing tip and a clipperAlong with that a   year warranty card The best thing about this product is the earphone Jack and a flat wire which in turn results in less occurrence of tangle About it is performance  it delivers a super bass quality sound  It fits properly on ears  so no complains till now  It feels awesome to listen as the quality of material along with the clarity in sound makes it different from other earphones  Hope it will last till long 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is my second earphone my first one was same of the same color  I just pulled the wired of the first one it lasted for   year  BOAT products are too much durable and I just love their bass and under     this is the great product and this product is better than jbl C   SI one  The sound are crisp and bass is boosted pros_ More bassGold plated jackmicrophone has a good range of capturing audioMicrophone just cancel the outdoor noise in most cases Vocal are goodTangle free cableAnd most ImportantPubg sounds are very clear you can play PUBG monile with this headphonesCons Driver unit is a little bit heavy But for me it does not create a problem because i have used this product for   year Vocal could be more clear My overall opinion As i have used this product for   year  My opinion will matter This product is durable and      worth the moneyI recommend this product to everyone               specially PUBG lovers   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am really impressed with these earphones  These are one of the few ones that have lasted for such a long time  close to a year  that too with rather loose maintenance care But what I am most impressed with is the customer service   The earphones did develop an issue with the mic volume being rather low  I was not actually sure if I should go for the warranty or just get a new one since it was so close to the warranty expiry  But I took a leap and contacted customer care regarding the issue and they promptly arranged the replacement at no cost to me  I am seriously impressed with this  it is the first time I am seeing this in India So kudos to BoAt    I am definitely looking you up the next time I need audio stuff PS   and with the price I am even more stunned  can not go wrong with these 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Once your original apple earpods are out of warranty and one of the earpiece stops working you will literally start to worry what to do next  coz investing    k bucks for warranty of just   year will certainly not be a great alternative to invest but then the question comes do we need to compromise the sound quality      well to answer these kind of questions  BOAT BASSHEADS     with MIC is definitely your answer considering its price and sound quality  Now let us talk directly about the pros and cons of it  Pros      Quality Sound      Yes But with few exceptions   Pumping Bass      Yes but with a condition and that is you must Download the song with best quality possible and Volume level must be atleast            only then you will feel it but since its common for almost every earphones so not a big deal even APPLE EARPODS NEEDS IT   Noise Cancellation       Definitely Yes  Comfort      Great   can be used even if laying on bed  no issues at all  Durability     Actually Good with Tangle Free cable   Inline Mic     Works Perfectly with its Multi Role ButtonCons     Weight   Slightly Heavier as compared to other earphones but not like some reviewer has mentioned like it keeps falling always   you just need the right earbuds and to add further extra hooks has been provided but then not recommended for workouts specially if you are doing cardio excercise    Looks    Not SuperCool But then its manageable   No Volume Control   After Prolonged use of regularly for     hrs for   months  you may start feeling little uncomfortable and slight pain but again if you use it alot like meOverall Verdict   Definitely Go For It considering the price and the sound quality also if you want MIC And can Ignore the Volume Control Buttons  I can say its a good alternative for apple earpods and as long as Boat keeps making these kind of products within these affordable prices i do not have to shift back to earpods I can not say about the after sales service since i have not encountered any problems yet Hope This Helps       
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I am reviewing it after   months usage Durability    First one stopped working so I contacted to manufacturer and they replaced it   They took more than    days to replace it which was pathetic because I had to buy a new earphone for the meantime   In the meantime I purchased Mi earphone at rs     only which is cheaper than this earhpone and quality is better than this Sound Qaulity    After       minutes regular usage you will feel uncomfortable because it starts paining due to it is design Material Quality   Material is good but it does not matter until you get great experience with sound quality Overall I am not happy with the quality  it is better to go with other earphones in the range of Rs     Rs     
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Normally one earpiece of my ear phones goes bad in     months   Even the expensive one from big brand who claim to be   the first company of sound engineers   did not last for more than   months  But this has been working absolutely fine for me and there is also no degradation in sound quality and clarity       RECOMMENDED  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good build quality  best sound quality  high durability and worthy for every penny 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have to say I am really annoyed with the purchase  the fit is very uncomfortable  I tried all the six pai uprs of ear buds   nothing worked for me  if you even move a bit the ear plugs falls off   so please try any other brand  Edit   after a month I still could not find a way to make it work  it keeps falling down   please avoid this piece  I tried  more piston it was slightly expensive than this but really awesome to listen and very comfortable   going to get one soon 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Sound quality is good at this price point but it is not the best Bass is killer but highs   lows are little bit fussy The earphones are made of metal so it is a bit heavy According to the durability it has a L shaped    mm jack gold plated so it is going to last long if someone is a heavy user or roughly use the earphones All over good earphone to buy   worth to buy you are not going to regret after buying this earphone 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am a music lover and most of the day I listens up the music and that too   hours approximatelyPros     Quality of material is really amazing and high premium quality wire has been used by manufacturers   Extra ears buds in various sizes as an extra accessories feels really soft to ears which is good for long hours usage without any irritation  feels very fit and comfortable   Amazing base and bits  clear vocals  beats  great and powerful output sound quality   Tangle free wire in flat shaped that is another great feature   head set cups made of metals for amazing performance and longer durabilityCons    that head set cups is little bit heavier but believe me after few days of usage does not even feel once you use to itOverall all its an great experience and thanks for boat for such amazing product
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I simply love this product  Its more than a product  a philosophy it is made with tons of love Everyone could make better headphones  but they do not  As if they want people to keep buying new ones This one is so so durable  the jack angle and material where it becomes a wire  is so optimised that it does not break   the packing was so wonderful  and the card inside it  talked about the headphone  and one could tell that they made it with a lot of love   the best part is the flat wires  and they have never entagled for me or my friends  ever  in months   the sound is very good  in this cost range  exceeds expectation  the plugs are metal  and that is so cool  they gave us so many earbuds  as if they really do not want us to throw it away just because we lost the budsThey are a young company  maybe  and it seems as if they are giving a tight slap into the face of the other headphone companies I simply love the product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worst product I  have ever bought  Sound quality is very poor  Bass is of no use  it is very heavy due to that metal bud keeps falling off often and often  Extra buds are of no use it does not adjust to my ears  can not use for more than  min I started getting headache  Continues use of it may lead to serious health issues  Regretting for wasting       for such a worst product  I do not know how people gave   stars  By reading the reviews I bought it and now threw it in the dustbin  For music lovers it is a big NO   Highly recommended not to buy  I give   star 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Sound Quality is below average  In Ear is only in the name  Does not sit comfortably  ideally in the ear  Very uncomfortable listening to music for long hours Previous purchases with better quality are listed as below  In order of preferences     Sony MDR EX   AP In Ear Headphones with Mic  Black     JBL T    In Ear Headphones with Mic  Black     Sennheiser CX     Street II In Ear Headphone  Black   without Mic
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have always used the original headphones that sony provided with their walkman series phones before android came  In case of issues  i havr always bought original headsets from sony centers brcause of their product and sound quality  This was the first time i invested in a headset from someone other than sony and i must say   these headsets are  very nice  They sound very good  They have buds so they block outside noice and you get to experience pure sound  The wires are also quite good in quality and are less like to get tangled  Good bang for yhe bucks Update     oct         my boats earphone the review for which I wrote above stopped working after more than   years of continuous and heavy use every single day of the year  With my experience of this earhone  I went and ordered the same earphone again without blinking an eye  Turns out  this time I received a duplicate or fake copy because the base is crappy  I tried the earphones on my laptop as well as on ma y of my phones the bass is just bad  really bad  The retailer who sent this piece to me sent a duplicate one  Shame on those pathetic losers  Just for the sake of     rupees  they threw their reputation out of the window  I did not expect such cheaply product from Amazon    the supermarket online store owned by the wealthiest jeff bezos  Unfortunately  ithrew the packaging away as soon as I unboxed the product and that is why I cannot go for a replacement  But really  to the seller   you disgust me
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Not a good purchase  Made mistake  Purchased  months back   Bow are my top   reasons   does not fit I to the ears properly  falls off quite often from either of the years    Absloutely no noise cancellation   Have been trying to use it on laptop to attend calls but found it a pain to do so
Smartdevices,1,OR,       DO NOT BUY THIS      WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT THOUGHT THEY CLAIM WARRANTY    Left side ear phone stopped working within   months of purchase  very poor  Their Customer care and warranty claim mechanism is very bad that I have sent my head phone back to them but do not where it is and it is been more than weeks and no response from their side       nobody picks call from the support side of Boat The ear bud is not intact  Keeps falling out every now and then Later got a replacement for the complaint i filed and again I got a defective product and different color I was fine with that  When connected to mobile   songs gets automatically paused and played continuously and never let us you to listen to songs at all 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Totally unsatisfied with the output  I baught these after buying Boat Avanti Soundbar  It is a magnificent product  But these bassheads     is a complete waste of money  I will prefer Jbl or Senheiser over these  Developers has completely forgotten to work on the mids  even after you try to equalise the output  only muffled bass comes out destorting your vocals and other mids  PLEASE do not fall prey on the low value and destort your ear sensitivity and urge to listen good music  Classical lovers should totally refrain from using these  Also I would like to mention the point that all the so called youtube reviewers have given very poor review  After you purchase the product you can conclude that they either have received hefty money for the review or they really do not understand anything about sound Once again  Do not buy it  Totally unsatisfied with this product Lesson learnt   If you are truly music lover then wait for some time  save money and buy good quality  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  A very durable metal bass heads head phones with mic  Good quality distortion noise free sound and tested at high volumes This who complained about not fitting to ear canal  need to change the provided earbuds  with the smaller size  Even I faced similar issue and changed to the smaller earbuds which gives a perfect fitting and does not drop off while walking or jogging 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best sound quality and bass with good noise cancellation  But music is felt too loud to handle some time due to the rich base  But if you are looking for rich bass  durable and low cost headphone  this is the one for you Cons    Rich bass   Highly durable  best for rough usage   Great noise cancellation   Loud sound   Low cost than other headphones   Highly durableCons    Music can be too loud sometimes   Treble is overpowered by the bass   can not stand sweat  If you are sweaty like me  sweat can enter the button using the flat wire  It may because you software glitches sometimes  which is a headache  But starts working after drying 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  First when i bought this i was thinking how it will be but It has the bestest sound quality in under      earphones  it is better than sony earphones Other companies do not have the wire quality like this earphone It has a great surround sound quality I tried more than   months and its giving meSame performance as it is new It has balanced sound   and noice cancelingFeature is good While calling microphone works well and quality is good I must tell you that if your budget is upto      rupees than it is best for you 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Painful for ears  can not keep it for long duration  Also  it keeps on falling from ears on every shift action you do  When others call  either they get irritated or I get irritated as the mic is useless and you need to continuously keep it in front of your mouth  I have seen other people talking on other earplugs easily talking without holding it continously  One ear plug stopped working even within guarantee period 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  A very good product for Rs        I am not an audiophile  but compared to other cheap earphones  this one is far superior in both physical and audible quality  The wire shows no signs of stress or strain even after   months of use  The audio also sounds  and feels  very good  as does the bass  Also has a mic and a button  which most earphones do not seem to have these days  Comes with extra earbuds  a clip  and earhooks  The wires are flat  which means very low chances of them entangling Worse part is that due to the quality  it is quite heavy  making it fall out of your ears  Thankfully  you can adjust the earbuds and make use of provided clip and hooks  but being light would have been better  Couple of months after purchase the volume dropped badly due to some internal problem  but it  almost  fixed itself a week later  I still hear some static on high bass  though  which is a shame for a  BassHead  All in all  it worked better than any other earphone I have bought so far  and seems like it will for a lot more time  I see the rate has increased now  I bought this specifically because it was cheaper than others  had a mic  and looked to be of good quality  If this is still the cheaper option out there  then I can assure you you will get the best bang for your buck  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I loved this earphone and very satisfied with its performance but their is one con that it comes out of the ear beacuse of its metal body so if you are ok with it then buy without thinking otherwise ant audio is best but you can not get the customer care experience of boat from ant 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This product was good for few months but after few months it malfunctioned so I gave it to the boat for replacement as it was in warranty period but now from more than a month I have been waiting for the replacement unit but there is no update and boat company customer care executives are also not taking the calls  Very bad service of boat Now I got my replacement unit about a month ago but still it is not working properly  the other isssues arrived in the replaced unit  Totally idiotic company it is  Disgusting  And never think that customer care executives will solve your problem because they will not be available to attend your calls 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Sound quality is much better than my previous JBL    EXCELLENT BASS   people should hear this to see the difference  People who are bass lovers should buy this immediately without second thought  using it daily during my gym routine   highly recommended for bass lovers and music lovers  buy it along with a pod to keep it safe from damage  five stars in total
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am using this product since last month     the product quality is very good  The sound is good and crisp the quality of the material is also very good  The bass and the noise cancellation is also up to mark     The only problem I faced in earphones is it does not fit the ears properly unit and less you used the ear holder    otherwise the product is very good   I suggest  This  product to everyoneAtlast I liketo thank Amazon for its amazing delivery services  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Good  the mic  I tried boAt s cheaper earphones and mic on this is definitely superior Bad   Bass  I was super excite after reading the reviews but I heard no bass at all  cheaper version had much better bass Ugly  design  these earbuds keep falling if you do any thing other than sitting idle  I tried all sizes of ear tips that were given but no luck  when I complained this to family  my cousin said that she also had problem with one of these and she switched to boAt bluetooth headphones This is after   to   days of usage  I will update after a month if my experience changes 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Mids and Vocals are bad If you adjust equalizer or not by default it has huge bass  And huge bass will irritates you while listening  product quality is poor and ear buds and speaker hook will make noise every time while you inserting into your ears  Overall  am not suggesting to buy anyone  If you are really a music lover  pay     or     more and go for high and standard one It has only  play    pause  and  next  functions   It does not have Volume controller which is disaster  every time if you want to increase or decrease  volume  you have to take your phone and control it  it is giving you pain Not worth for the money 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The bass is very good but after using two months this earphone has started showing sound problems  It automatically increases and decreases phone or laptop volume or will repeatedly turn on the google assistant  Initially i thought it might be a problem with my mobile but same problem when i tested this with other phone and laptop too  Very irritating while watching videos or listening to songs  almost damaged my eardrums as it suddenly raised the volume yo maximum multiple times  Have raised a complaint at their website  let us hope they provide a replacement 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  If you are a jogging   gymming person and want to pump yourself up with some good music then this is definitely a cool choice  But hey  you need to be little careful with purchasing decisions as mic might be problematic Mic of my boat headphones went off in  th month after purchase  Yes  it can be replaced as it has a year warranty but I just want this problem to never arise on the very first note 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The Headphone stopped working after    days of purchase  I tried reaching the customer service via call for     days continuously but always busy tone comes  Pathetic customer service  Product too not that good  I will not recommend buying the headphone 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  If any body want to buy this earphone I recommend you to do not buy this one Sound quality is average and biggest disadvantage is it is very dis comfortable in ear while listening songs when you travel  I do not want to listen songs in this earphone Its ear piece sometimes stuck in ear and earphone comes out  And you can not return it in my area only replace is able Very disappointed with this product if their is negative rating I will give it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I do not know why people gave nice ratings for this product  I received product today  when I start listen the music comes like local earphones  Full sound without clarity  I am not able to listen seriously  I requested for replacement now  I have only one option now  There is no refund  Now I came to know if we invest much money only we get good music  Previously I had Sony earphone which is worth of RS         Compared to that it is totally waste  Better Samsung earphone with earbuds are best than this  Samsung earphones are       only  I brought this for        Please do not buy  Full volume but no clarity 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This is my second boat headphones  and they have the same issue  The extra pieces of ear cover do not fit the diameter of the headphones  so if you lose the original piece  the headphones are pretty much useless  I thought it was an issue only with my first headphones but the new ones have the same problem  Can the manufacturer help 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Excellent headphones       VFM headphones from Boat   Material quality  Very good quality headphones  Ear pieces are sturdy  rubbers are soft  good quality wires tangle free flat wires  Design  A personal variable  but i think it looks cool  but a little bit on the heavier side due to those metallic inserts on ear piece Mic   Good quality mic  with in line controls  Provides a decent call clarity  Decent noise cancellation  though not the perfect SOUND   Its really a great headphone for its price especially when we consider the sound quality  I felt  its too loud when compared to other good quality headphones  Trebles and mids are excellent  Bass is so good  but mind you do not conpare it with an xtrabass sony   But for the price its giving excellent bass Overall  except the loudness  its a superb buy at this price point   I would say  if you love bass n quality  in a below     rs range these are the best to go for If you have little more budget to get a balanced music  go for JBLc   si  If you want deep powerfull bass quality n have a well stretched budget  go for Sony XB   or Seinheiser cx   s
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very disappointed with customer service and the warranty conditions  I would replaced the product within   year warranty   the replaced started malfunctioning within   months  BoAt s representative are saying that replacement of replaced product is against their policy  this emerges a doubt whether the replacement was original or refurbished Regarding the product  the sound quality is amazing  the noise cancellation is good  a very bass for bass lovers but the piece is little heavy  so you might find it a little uncomfortable but so are the other earphones I have recommended few of my friends for this product or other products from BoAt as I find it an amazing piece apart  from the customer service at this price 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  These earphone have really good sound quality but the earbud design is very poor and uncomfortable  Even after trying multiple earbud sizes given in package it still does not feel comfortable  The metallic design is the primary culprit for this problem  Its too big and feels heavy on ears and keeps falling out  Also its just straight like rod without any tilt to adjust with ear angle unlike most earphones which do come with little tilt to easily fit in ears 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  No complaints  not looking for a super high quality listening so I find this best one out there for low budget yet good quality listening Best feature  flat wire and angled jack  these two feature makes it more lasting and moreover you get bunch of earbuds Side note  remember to hang the wire around your neck as you put on your earphones because it is little heavy and tends to slip off every now and then 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  CONS  The sound is horrible  it does not capture the most basic frequency range properly  If you are into guitar based music like Rock and Metal  then this is going to disappoint you  The bass is middy and does not cover the low end properly  the mids sound scooped  the treble falls short of its full range  It also has a very phony surround sound which makes it harder to hear what is really playing  The earphones fail to do what they are intended for PROS  The material and the overall quality is nice  the earphones are sturdy  The packet also comes with superfluous accessories  so no issue there 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Listen   all the zist and proper points  I am reviewing it after  year over and still working good    The packaging quality is superb    Low budget nice headphone    Headphone material is also good    Though it has tangible wires  but i get many times gets messy    The sound quality is awesome  It has good bass  good treble  Deep and punchier coz its freq response is tood good comore to other brands  But you might found the clarity is bit less as compare to JBL  SEINHEISSER  SONY  There is noise little bit    The mic was preety decent before but now it works bt still other person over the phone gets very disturbed coz it creates lots of noise   dnt know why    Last  I will say   you can go for it without hesitation  if ur range is within     to     
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Audio QualityThe Audio quality of these headphone is really good compares to others in this price range  Boat promised what they say out of box  Extraaaa Bass  the Bass of these headphones are really high compared to others  An overall the sound output of this headphones are very high  During my test  I found these headphones have good audio quality compare to others at this price  If you like EDM and pop songs  then you love these Boat headphones  But I suggest reducing a volume of your phone while listening Sufi and romantic songs because by default these headphones have higher volume  so you did not feel clear audio  The once again Bass effect is really good with treble and vocal  You can easily distinguish between different instruments   sounds which are good for extra bass ComfortWhen coming to comfort  first I am not very impressed with these headphones  but after a select right pair of ear tips  I feel better  If you use this boat headphones for a long time  then you feel a little bit awkward because of big capsule design  On the Noise Isolation  Boat BassHeads     are very good  Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation   comfort  I use these headphone while bike driving and I were not able to hear outside noise  that is really amazing  If you get popping issue which these earphones  then please use Ear Hooks provided with earphones Final WordsAfter comparison with other headphones  I say the Boat boAt BassHeads     is the best headphones around     Rs with a microphone  It has a solid build quality  good performance  low price  and more important extreme Bass  I highly recommend these headphones for Bass lovers   budget conscious people who are looking for high quality   durable earphones at a reasonable price    If you found this review to be helpful at all  please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know  Thank you so much    
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The earphones are pretty good  It gives a decent sound output with quite a good amount of bass  People saying the bass is not good have definately damaged their eardrums already so do not fall for their words The discomforts I felt was as the earphones are little heavy so I have to use hooks so that they do not fell out from my ear but plonged use of the earphones  little over one hour  make me uncomfortable  Secondly the jack is    degrees bent so if the phone is my pocket while I am riding my bike  a little twist in the jack causes it to disconnect from phone 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have used boat products previously and suddenly all my friends have started recommending me Boats products  I work in the Film industry where the sound is one of the most essential elements and no matter whether you have or have not  a good earphone is a must Apple gives good earphones but they break after a while but the sound quality they provide is excellent  The problem is that first  they are super expensive and second  they do not last long Most other earphones in the same range will give far inferior product and their sound quality is so bad that it will only damage your eardrums and give your headaches  Here is a detailed view of why I find the Boat earphones to be one ofthe best that there is       Pros If you are ordering from Amazon  then you have a well packed good product in your hands  I have also found that I am unable to find the Boat products easily in the general market  Wires are like strap  flat and very strong  Unlike earphones which gives you a rubbery feeling  these earphones will give you more of a plastic feeling  The wire does not coil itself and if it does  it is easy to open it because of the of the smooth strapped flat shape of wires  The sound is amazing  It does not break even when I took the volume a little higher  They are easily stuck on ears and does not fall off  The wire is long enough for you to put laptop one side and watch movies from a distance  The microphone is also awesome as I sang songs and made voice notes  for which it was clear and precise  Sometimes more than required  It even captured my breathing sound from a distance  The earbuds have a metallic look and are strong  There is no question you have to buy another earphone for an entire year  It comes with an entire set of different custom earbud covers  It helps because different people have different ear sizes and according to them they can use it for their ears  It also comes with cervical ear support which helps in putting an earbud to connect more impactfully to your ear without giving you pain  It helps if you do not want earbuds to fall in case of strong movements  Most important  though the price is less  the boat products do not look very cheap and boasts of a good brand name       Cons Are you kidding me  Till now there are no cons for me  With the price tag attached to it  it is literally the best bargain you can get on an earphone  My brother has two of them in different colours and loves them       Final OpinionDont think twice before ordering it  There are tremendously good reviews all over for Boat products and lately  I have seen more and more people leaning towards this product  I cannot tell you how many people have recommended me this earphone and those friends of mine have never faced any problem of any kind Without a doubt  the best company that there is today on Amazon  If you are planning to buy it  do it  You will not regret it       
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent build quality and tangle free cable  sound quality   is good coming base qaulity is excellent and volcals are clear       Quality  IS good and tangle free cable   And build quality is alluminium and Excellent build qualityNoise cancellation  is good noise cancel but sometimesPrice   IAM buy this product lightening deals     price may vary to day to day Pros   build quality   tangle free cable etcThis my review person to person may vary to
Smartdevices,5,OR,  For a moderate users it is very good but not for Only listing High quality of music    Build Quality is Very Good  tangle free wire and metal Ear pods    Ear buds are really good and there are various type of spare ear buds provide which really nice for different ear    Good quality of Pouch provided  optional  for carry and keep safe    Mic quality is very good and notice cancellation is nice refined only cons is only single button for mute and unmute mic  no other button for change music 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The sound is fuller than most products in this range  the volume is intense and can never push it to full because it gets too loud  You can wear them on a bike with helmet on and in a gym environment where loud music is already playing in the background as this drown out everything  they are not sweatproof or water resistant so be careful  Any sweat will disrupt the earphone and might render the mic useless  The earphones are extremely comfy  the extra ear tips are in various sizes therefore can fit almost all ears  I replaced the stock with the smaller ones for a snug and comfy fit that does not pain after prolonged use  The wire is actually tangle free and the build quality is overall satisfactory even sturdy  The downside and the reason why I am not giving it   stars is that the mic stopped working   day after my return to amazon date expired  So within a week the mic went kaput  Just will not work 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  For someone who would not bother even visiting the product listing again  I am forced to write this review Let me put the record straight  this has to be one of THE BEST headphones in its category for sure  I have never used a Sony  JBL or Sennheiser before  but I could confidently bet my money on boAT for sure To begin with  the BASS  It not only vibrates the innermost part of your ears but can potentially blow your skull away     literally I had purchased the Motorola Pulse Escape  Bluetooth  headphones for around Rs        and could not have been happier to have exchanged them for this pair For under Rs       this is an absolute steal  Go for it without a second thought Good job boAT team    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Pros Good build quality Earpieces are metallic build  strong build and excellent fit and finish Flat type tangle free wires which are strong enough to withstand rough handling    degree bend pin helps a lot while using with any smartphone kept in hip pocket Compatibility with many smartphone brands The earpieces have excellent fit in the ear canal  resulting in almost      ambient noise cancellation Cons    IMHO   the metallic earpieces are a bit little too heavy  they tend to fall off the ear due to their own weight  if the earpieces are kept a little loosely  to allow me to listen to somebody sitting next to me  or be aware of ambient sounds while driving through bad traffic and have to take a call     If I try to fit them tightly in the ear canal so that they will not fall off easily  then another problem arises   the lowest volume in my Mi Note   Pro sounds TOO LOUD for my ears  Since I cannot reduce the phone s volume any more  I have to keep the earpieces a little loose in the ear canal  And then they tend to fall off again  due to their weight and the loose fit  Maybe this is a compatibility issue with this particular phone model Mi Note   Pro  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Update  i bought these headphones on   th of march      and i do not even remember when it stopped working  i think within     months   and it felt more heavy than earrings in my ears finally i threw in the garbage and ordered jbl c   l something like that do not remember the name exactly  they had very bad wire quality  broke within two months and     more than older version jbl c    decent average sound quality  durable enough  which i used almost   years    finally i am using my more than   years old Sennheiser cx      just miss the mic but it has awesome sound quality light weight  long hours usage without hurting my ears and durable wires And it works surprisingly too good while playing pubg using in built mic of mobile  No issues at all in any terms Old review  They fall easily from my ears even after trying every earbud size  Rest are just fine  Built quality is good 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  My purpose of buying these headphones were mostly for meetings and calls as the maximum volume supported by my phone is not much  here is the review for my one month usage of these headphones  note that they are more based on the usage on call than listening to music Pros    Tangle free flat wire with good wire length   Buds completely insert in ear holes and provide ample noise cancellation   Extra buds supplied with the pack   Mic is almost in level to the mouth while speaking   L shaped jack makes it easier for connecting to laptops or phones in pocketCons    Mic is not so sensitive  voice gets unclear if its idling at some distance from mouth  Have to be held close to mouth while talking   Ear buds do not fit everyone is ear and may keep on falling if your ear holes are smaller than average   Buds fall off sometimes from its place  not firmly assembled   Mic may get tangled to shirt collar while walking or sitting  Have to be properly adjusted Even after these cons I will give it   rating as they are the best value for money wired earphones available in the market right now 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  First let me tell all here I am listening walkman since March       i have listened  sony aiwa  headphone for last    years and i must say this  headphone currently best clear treble Mega bass I am really surprised by the sound quality of this product  I am not a boat fan but those who are giving neagative  either they are anti bass fan or they have bad intention of maligning boat and those who are in doubt my advise is to them go ahead and buy without hesitation I would like to buy another one very soon Thanks boat and amazon for faster delivery  bass   star treble   star
Smartdevices,2,CG,  This is not original   it is first copy of boAt         Original is available only on Myntra
Smartdevices,4,CG,  i have been using this headset for past few months have dropped it couple of times the build qlty is excellent sound is amazing especially bass good of music lovers tangle free i used jbl before feels this one is better  if you are a melody listener   you should go for jbl as it has better sound quality and treble if you prefer edm jazz pop hiphop movies this one is for you guys
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am using this earphone and I found it very good  If soomeone is planning for this earphone then definitely go for it you will not disappointed by it  Earlier I used skullcandy   I also have skull candy headphone which is more better than earphone  and jbl earphone  This one is better than them Everything is good and nice in this earphone  Even I find it better than any earphones I used before do not mind any negative reviews which is present here Everything has some cons and pros but I am sure you will find its pros more than its cons So do not bother by any negative review present here  go for it if you are planning Everything is perfect in this earphone whether it is sound balance  clarity  bass  quality  noise isolation all are perfect 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros    Durable   Comes with a sports wear  so that the earplugs do not drop of when you exercise    Tangle free cable   Has   set of earpieces of different sizes   two colours Grey and Black    Good Noise CancellationCons    Has more Bass   Muffled Mids   The frequency output is not really average but when tweaked can sound pretty good Have been using it for two years  mostly while travelling in the city Works just fine 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Earphone ear piece is too big for ear opening and as a result it is almost impossible to comfortably ise them  They keep falling off of ears as they are unfit  Sound quality is fine but no point if can not be used due to such a big ear piece 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Hey guys My earphone busted in   months  Tried reaching Boats customer care  no one picks up the phone  Created a ticket and no response for the past   weeks  Do not buy their products if you are expecting warranty claims This is my  rd Boats headphone and my first time claiming warranty  Pathetic service  I feel bad for recommending this to my friends and colleagues  going to go back to JBL again Update  after a month of following up on Boat Facebook support  they have replaced my earphone  There is no other way to reach the boat support team but just through FB only  Hope this helps 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The product does not do justice to the high ratings  It is not as good as others make it seem  I am an audiophile and I have used tens of headphones and earphones  and it is one of the worst I have used Pros   It is not expensive and hence most can afford it    It has really good bass  and hence if that is the only thing you need  go ahead    It is sturdy as the earpieces are made of metal  Falling on the ground does not harm it any way  Even sitting on it by mistake will not do any damage  Better than plastic earpieces in that regard Cons   The sound quality is horrible after you go above     volume  It sounds like those cheap speakers in marriage halls    The volume at full capacity is very very loud  loud enough to make one partially deaf    The worst of it all  It is very heavy and hence starts hurting the ears within a few minutes of usage    It has very poor noise cancellation unless you literally stuff it inside your ear canal which hurts even more    It is definitely not a product for lon term usage as you will always have pain in your ear canal and may also damage your eardrums if played at higher volumes Verdict   Buy Sennheiser  Sony or Philips  may last less but you will enjoy the experience 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent sound  Really Loud      volume in mobile is enough to make you satisfy with music  The main highlight of this earphone is bass  which can be easily felt   sizes of ear ear plugs are given   sets each  plus an ear holder  The wires are flat and tangle free  Looks premium and nice  Really durable with metal body  Thanks amazon for giving it        only  Real Pics are given for ur reference 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  i am giving  stars only to make it appear at top  i am strictly do not going to buy this again  they reduced the quality of the product  cable is super tanging  cheap joints  cheap plastic  short cable  see above pictures i shared  comparing with original green coloured i brought few months before    i brought this from  seller techfire  official  i do not know even this is orginal of not 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I always used to buy which ever earphones were lower in price and assumed those were good   They used to give trouble after some time   Worst was when speakers work fine but mic goes bad and we will not realize until the person on the other end keeps asking us to repeat   This earphones with mic from boAt is so good where I bought it by chance when my previous earphones failed   I realized this is too good for its price   Clarity of speakers is fantastic and the mic is also great   I use this not just for listening to music but use this for conference calls and singing too   Now that we have online classes for school kids  I bought a second one recently for my kid 
Smartdevices,1,OR,    of us brought this item but what happened with every one of us is that one side of earphone stopped working so we placed a request for repair with the company  They repaired it but again after one year the same issue started to occur again  Now nothing could be done and we had to throw it out   We went for it because of the price and reviews  If it had not happened to you sooner believe me it will happen to you and you will throw it out under   years  The sound is decent  the bass is loud but the sound does not feel that good  If you are strictly on a budget then go for such low priced earphones from any brand  I have used a lot of high quality earphones and headphones over the last few years and hence I can say that I did not feel that premium or HD sound or whatever you call from this product  This is the case with all the products from any brand under this range  It is not a bad product  I just did not feel the richness in quality after using so many good products 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I purchased this earphone seeing the discount thinking it would live upto the specifications but really it did not  Something which I liked is the build quality it is just awesome but in case of audio output I had to go for an equaliser and still did not feel upto the mark  Clarity       bass effect      treble       mids     overall sound mix    are my observations  Guys do not waste your money on this       you can if you have extra Money to buy another one  Believe me senheiser cx     provided me  better in all aspects  sound  Never expect  Super extra Bass  or maybe my product is faulty      check yours very carefully  I do not know about other Boat products  higher models may be good
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I love this Earphones  first thing is first  it actually lasts IT ACTUALLY LASTS LONG YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY OTHER EARPHONES  ESPECIALLY HIGH QUALITY EXPENSIVE ONES I HAVE BOUGHT THAT did not EVEN LAST A MONTH  This however has lasted for almost   months I am an extremely rough user of earphones and I have wasted more money on Earphones than anything and dear lord  this is certainly the best earphone I have ever used  now they do not have the highest sound quality like Sennheiser ones  but they certainly have the durability  you have no idea how many times I have connected and removed this earphone in the past   months after buying a connector for a PC  no I do not have any other Earphones  just this one which I plug back and forth on my pc and phone  and it never got damaged  it did however give slightly less noise on either side  but they got fixed automatically once I just left them for a few hours  and other than that and the earbuds falling off easily  I have no other concern Seriously  if you need a long lasting  durable Earphones then go for it  it may not look durable but it certainly is one  I am a very heavy person who lied down on many earphones underneath me and damaged them  and this one  this one is the first to escape my heaviness unharmed  usually earphones I lie down on just get damaged and will have low  unbalanced sound on either of those earphones forever  but not this  this fixes itself somehow and works when left alone for a few hours Again  the sound quality is high but not the best like other expensive ones  but this sure has the durability alright  high quality durability perfect for an extremely rough user 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Edit  Having used it for a month now  I just tossed it into trash can for not performing as expected and the ergonomics are way off  Simply not suited for wearing beyond   mins  This product is overwhelmingly overrated    thousand plus reviews with   stars got me thinking this must be really good   For the price it over delivers what it offers  But this is something not meant even for a novice audiophiles  The bass on it is quiet over powered unless it is toned done via an EQ  But still does not help for anything else like using it for calls  listening to vocals  movies or even games  This is best suited for those bass oriented ballywood and bojpuri songs which makes your head explode  it is in the same league of those aweful Skullcandy  beats and Sony  Over all  it is a well rounded package in terms of bass performance and nothing else
Smartdevices,5,OR,  These are perhaps one of my absolute favourite earphones  The build quality is premium  and the number of earbuds are impressive too When I lost my old earbuds  same ones  i went ahead and bought some other bluetooth earphones headphones  but ultimately  I needed a wired one too  that is when I decided to go back to boat  it was either this  tried and tested  or the new variant they got  I went for this because I know how they are  And I was not disappointed Only two issues I feel are Black shows greysteel metallic finish where earbud is  but we get green steel The second is a bit of an actual issue  the hooks  however impressive  do not have a proper location on the earbud piece  if they had designed the earbud piece in a way that the hook could snuggly fit  or atleast not have a chance of getting removed  I would be happy  but it has a tendency to move around  and I really need that hook for using the earphones  I do not mind getting   bud set than   and instead get   sets of hooks instead Overall       
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this after I lost my Boat Bassheads      I loved them and thought this     will be a better upgrade So many positive reviews here  hence I bought them But I returned them the same day I listen to ALL sub generes of EDM  some heavy metal and some bollywood music too So I tested this earphones with all of them generes I used    kbps mp s and FLAC files running through a quad DAC from my LG V   to test this earphones  SOUND QUALITY  Lows are thumpy and un natural Mids are dull Highs are non existent  forget clarity Very un balanced overall sound BUILT QUALITY  Great build quality Very sturdy and premium earcups  seemed durable Tangle free and a good quality cable LOOKS  Mine were in Molten Orange colour  looked fantasticTL DR    for sound quality    for built quality    for looks      for value for moneySound quality is the only reason I returned this product  I recommend you to NOT TO BUY this Choose something from Audio Technica  Senhiser or Sony Hope this helps  Peace   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I need to divide the feedback into two sections The product selection  ordering and delivery from Amazon was flawless  Everything was just perfect The second section is the tricky part  I am A BOAT fan as I have been using couple of headphones from them  This was a gift for my wife who misplaced her headphones  The packaging was excellent and she really liked it The issues started appearing from the  rd day  The cable from the left earpiece worn out and no sound was coming out  The very next day  the ear cushion started to deteriorate  I had misplace the original packaging so replacing this might not be possible but I am disappointed 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Looking for earphones online   This may be the best choice for you  if you are a stock android useR  this earphone provides the best hearing experience Some users reviewed that the sound get deteriorate above           but NO     the sound is still crispy and detailed even on      volume  The Black colour looks more classy then other colours  it has a shiney pink tint on it which looks beautiful  if we talk about comfort    do they well played here  these are so comfortable  but we can purchase same audio quality earphone through the market   like ubon big daddy bass for less than     rs but the durability  and comfort is not same as these earphones
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am surprised  I never expected such bad product from Boat  I bought this product just   weeks back and I find quality is really bad First of all  it slips frequently out of your ear  due to its metal body  Secondly  voice is not at all clear  while you talk to someone on phone  Listening music is just ok I bought it while seeing other customers ratings  they could be right also but I doubt perhaps now boat is compromising with product quality 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Build Quality  The Heads of the headphone and the Button are made out of metal so there is an added rigidity  bonus  along with the gold plated Pin feels good   Only downside  the platic wires feel bit weak at the jointsSound quality  is great compared  to the price tag  tested     surround sound which felt really great due to the high bass  and due to that  gaming will be really easy and goodDeeper bass for  games is always good Truly Boat has impressived me and now I am at Nirvana
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Material quality was sooooooo bad its been only   months and this headset is totally crashed  It started    days after I started using First the songs and videos were changing automatically without doing anything  Calls received using headphones got disconnected automatically phone volume started changing automatically  This was happening as soon as headset is put on phone  It was frustrating  And now finally one of the mesh net on headphone is broken while I was cleaning it plz do not buy it on amazon they are selling duplicate copies I guess Did not expected this from Amazon   Boat as my previous headset was durable for more than   months which was bought from a proper shop 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The product is OK for    days and after face  the mic issues Overall sounds are good Built in quality is good Overall Headset quality is good Thanks for the amazon guidelines for replacement But I received the product with out extra accessories which was provided earlier  customer service needs to be improved Even now after   months  it is not working    Very cheap quality products
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Perfect sound clearance   with best base boost with clearity   Comforting earbuds with different sizes and a earpiece for hold on grip for gym use etc  Earbuds provided with   colours so its your choice how you want your earphones to look like   For more convinienece buy this earphone with boat case which helps you carry your earphone with ease and keeping it safe too   Although the metal body of earphone is best premium look and trustworthy with gold plated jack   And the case is also not only cloth made but its hard and has some plastic or metal inside it making it unbreakable   And this earphone is tangle free and does not attract dust easily   the left earplug had mic and has a pause play button inside it  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Very nice product  Boat have a very nice set of earphones below     rupees  Trustable and also value for money  We will get some local chineese brands below this range  But they will not be durable It is very glad to know that they provide one year warranty to their products They are having good bass and sound quality is just superb  At first it was not fitted in my ear  But after using the rubber  it is comfortably sticking to my ears Very nice experience with the product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought black colour to my brother it works nice  I like that and again I put an order white colour for myself  I received a damaged product  audio jack is slightly bend and doest not fit to my phone  so I return  And put a new order I received again same damaged piece  The I give replacement  In replacement too I received same damaged product    times same damaged products  Later I put refund and do not have idea to have this headset again
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This was my second purchase of this earphone  This time mic stopped working after    days of billing  means    days of regular daily     hrs use  Even in last earphone right ear stopped working after   months and after repair replacement by Boat  again stopped working in both year after    months  Whatever it offers is zero if we get the worst durability 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I bought Boat bass heads     yesterday morning  I used this continuously for   hours for listening to music and made calls also During my use in the first day  I found that this headset is awesome  Previously  I was using an AKG headset with USB C connectivity  Compared to that I found the sound quality is at par or even better Things I love     Tangle free    L shaped connecting end    Comfortable ear bud    Long enough to keep my phone in my pant pocket while making calls or listening music    Sound quality is good    Adequate noise cancelation    Good bass    Design is cool Things I do not like As of now there are nothing I hate about this one  I will keep updating when I find something in future Hope this will not be a disappointment in long run 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Dear Audiophiles Let me start with saying you that if you are spotify gaana Wink users  please pay and upgrade your account  If you can not pay for these services  download songs to phone from other sites and listen in phone  Online basic account gives you pathetic music quality Coming to the headset  most probably you guys are like me who do not know much about highs and lows  all we care is Clarity and Bass  In that context I must say this headset is pretty ok  There is too much hype for Bass of this headset but I found it below the bass of JBL  In this headset Above    percentage volume  bass dominantes vocals which in turn results in a situation where you can not catch the lyrics of song  But I think normally people plays songs at    percentage or less Ok I know you guys are in a hurry  so let me put it in a nut she will as follows Physical noise cancellation     Sturdiness and Hardware Quality     Comfort level     Aesthetic       Personally varies Vocals      upto     volume  After that pathetic Final Verdit  If you need     qualityBass       good vocals go for JBL but its not Durable  Damages easily   Around      If you need just     quality bass       good vocals and good durability this boat headset is an option If you need      bass       Good clarity vocals Durability  Comfortness   go for One More bullets headsets       NB  I have with me these headsets models only  that is why I posted a comparison realted to those  I am not an reviwer but an audiophile by heart Like if you found useful 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  If you are in a rush and immediately purchased it because of high number of reviews  then it is fine  Because when so many people purchase a product it creates an effect in the mind that this must be good  that is why everyone is buying it  But if you have throwly investigated the price bracket for various headphones  you can buy better than this Why Base  not premiumDurability   not the best of classSound   very good but not HDI tried Ant audio before this which lasted more than one year  I purchased this now because this was the only competitor and I want to test it for my personal comparison  This is nothing compared to Ant audio Ant Audio W   Base is beyond a        Earphone  It is more strong  Sound is premium and HD  absolute noise cancellation even in Flight seat near wings I listen to a variety to music from EDM to Hard Rock  This headphone is not an audiophile headphone  But still very good quality sound  But Sound is not enough for my taste Buds Note   in one month one side stopped working  Now let us see if the replacement is hassle free or not 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The Boat Bass heads     is an affordable pair of earphones  and the relatively low price makes it accessible to a very wide audience  It is designed and marketed to be bass heavy  and we found that claim to be true These earphones also get really loud but will only appeal to a certain set of buyers  If you are a bass head who enjoys a thump in your music  these earphones are good for the price they command  If you prefer a neutral or a bright sound  these are not for you Pros Excellent build qualityBundled ear hooksCan get loudCons Oversensitive microphoneBass overpowers mids and highsRatings Design  comfort     Audio quality       Value for money       Overall     
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Honestly I feel like the old     bassshead headphones are too good purchase of mine from boat    Seriously of thought this     would be updated version but it is too bass and hav to use equilizer to some songs    I really miss old     boat headphones and bad thing is boat company stopped making it    i think because I did not found one  if you hav one plz tell me   
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Trendy color  metal casing  lengthy flat wire and good sound quality for the price  Product comes with   different sizes of ear plugs and a pair of ear hooks  Fixing the ear hooks was not very intuitive  Had to google to figure it out   However the plugs and hooks do not fit well for me  Bit disappointment with the fitment and hence no   stars  BA should improve on this area  Wanted to return this item only for that reason  But there is no return option  only replacement is available 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Just received today not damaged everything working normally still not upto the mark  So I am writing cons first Cons   Too much bass  Imagine watching a movie the music is louder than the voice  and the bass does not seem natural Seems artificial  Not the best quality sound   If you want to try out the other silicon buds the provide  Good luck  it is  no less than a wrestling  You will feel like it will get damaged if you use that much force but you need to do it still if you want to use those buds otherwise use the ones that come by default Pros    budget earbuds but as I mentioned bass is too much  So amazon basic is a better budget earbud  Even though Amazon basic looks and seems cheap the price is under cheap despite that it provides decent sound which is more than satisfactory   The wires are beautiful and tangle free   They provide a lot of spare buds useless as I mentioned before  and clips and such   The L shaped jack really helps a lot Overall  it is just an earphone with too much extra unnecessary bass My Skullcandy smoking earbud mic stopped working so I ordered this one  but Skullcandy sound is far far better than this 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I had bought on a recommendation as a backup pair but found them very underwhelming  The sound quality is below average  I am used to soundmagic e   range and these have too much noise compared to those  Even soundmagic es  s or es  s are better in those terms  but they are very fragile and I do not buy them  Build quality looks good for the price though 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not buy this product  The left speaker stopped working before my first month was even over Total wast of money I think I should have invested more and bought from JBL or Sony Very bad customer care service  The number given in the box does not work  Every time I call on the number  it says  Wrong number  No reply for the email sent by me even do not be foolish and buy this product you will be sorry if you do 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Overall boat Bassheads     looks premium feels premium and also last like a premium headphones does Earphone plugs are smooth not at all irritating   material quality  Sound quality is pretty much good and not the best what you get in high end earphonesBut for this money these earphones seals the dealCall receiving button is cleverly placedBut one down side is the earpods keeps falling of from ears because they are little bit heavy apart from that its a score Unfortunately this earphone stopped working after a week of my purchase I have sent it back to boat customer service itself they have taken forever to send a replacement item totally disappointed with this product
Smartdevices,4,OR,  No Complaints as far as price to quality goes Having used much expensive headphones  these are descent enough  Tested on Laptop and Phones The Goods   Build Quality for the price  Sturdiness  Bass I mean it really just that   Ok for Gaming if you tweak it properly with softwares The Bad   Very Suppressed  Vocals  But that can be tweaked to personal Requirements using softwares  i used Sonic Studio   Using Continuously for long hours      may because pain in ears I mean that is it I think for the price it comes at   their s not much to complain about 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using Sony MDR XB  AP since past   years and i love it  Being a basshead  i want my earphones headphones to have good bass  A week back i had gone to my native for vacation and forgot my earphones there  Now i did not want to take the risk of courier as it might get spoiled on the way So until my next trip a couple months later i had to make do with an alternate cheap earphones  was checking out bass earphones under     and my eyes fell on this  The reviews were good so i decided to give it a shot  And i was pleasantly surprised to be honest with the sound quality  The bass is good and punchy  The wire is tangle free  and it has a mic too  still to test mic quality   But overall a bargain at the price  If you are a lover of deep punchy bass and want a earphone at a reasonable price go for it  You will not be disappointed 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I had used boat wired earphone before  based on that experience I have taken chance to buy this  Unfortunately  this time it does not worth it because of the following reasons     Never stays in ear  even for a simple head roation or little jerk will make earphone to fall from ears  really pathethic and I have even tried with all the bud sizes dilevered along with the box  It does not make any sense when the earphones will not stay on your ear  its absoulte useless and I am surpised to so many postivie review despite such malfunction    Sound Audito clarity is poor and quality is not as expected which really upsets  voice call clairty is even bad Only best part thing is the length of the chord and flat wires seems to be of good quality Overall  I will not recommend anyone to buy this  absoulte useless 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  TL  DR  This is the worst product I have ever ordered from Amazon   do not buy this Pros    Sound quality is satisfactory and bass is optimum    Wire is tangle free Cons   And this is really big    The design is NOT AT ALL ergonomic and DOES NOT hold onto ears  Forget being comfortable  it will hurt your ears and will keep slipping from the ear    Do not buy this at all as it is non returnable and can only be replaced   It is heavy and thus helping even more in the above point I can not stress enough by saying that do not go for this product  There are much better products out there 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Bought this product   months back  the earphone was damaged and was not able to hear because of some internal damage near pin  Replaced it with same new product    days back and now mic is not working  Such a bad service from boats and amazon  For my bad  i suggested my other two friends to buy the same earphone but now they are also not happy with the product  earphones are good only for few days 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I have been using this earphone for a few months and here are the pros and cons Pros  the earphones look sturdy and durable because of the flat wire  The L shaped pin makes it very comfortable to use  The wire length is decent  The sound is okay Cons  it is extremely uncomfortable to wear these because the earpieces are made from metal and is big which does not stay in the ear no matter what  I tried changing the earbuds but none of them sit in my ears  The extra rubber add ons that are given helps in keeping the earphone in your ears but are extremely painful  The sound is mediocre  I own a boat basshead     which has amazing sound quality and bass but this is way below that  I do not see the fun of buying earphones that do not sit your ears anyway  a waste of money for me
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought this on    august       I used it approx   year  but this year on    august       the voice gets distorted   it is an inbuilt problem and there is no physical damage  there is an official website of boat  support boat lifestyle com  here you can claim your product warranty  So I claimed my warranty and next day I got email which shows that my claim is approved  and next day a delivery boy call me for reverse pickup  They replaced my earphone and I got my product back after    days  brand new   It tooks time to replace but I am satisfied with this new earphone and after sale service  Love BOAT
Smartdevices,2,OR,  There is too much hissing sound in the earphone  initially I thought that the particular piece which I received has some defect so I replaced it but the second time when I got the other piece then again I found the same issue which make me realise that there is some quality issue in the earphone And another thing which I disliked about the earphone and I also found many other people complaint about it is that it regularly fell out of the ear Though the voice is quite loud and bass is also very good I generally avoid giving total negative review but this time I am giving such a review because I am really very disappointed by the product  I am not saying that boat product is not good infact I am using boat     earphone which is quite good  so it is just about this particular model
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It looks really good  Acceptable sound quality  However  it is very heavy  badly designed and easily slides off from the ears whichever bud you use  It is very important to have some sort of locking mechanism for heavy earphones  This one has black spurs provided alongwith which are supposed to be some sort of locking mechanism  However  it is a mere gimmick and doesnot offer any locking whatsoever  I will give it the title  most poorly designed product of the year   I regret purchasing it and had to get another as it will not sit in the ear even for   minutes on its own 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  PLEASE READ IT TILL THE END FOR A TRUSTWORTHY REVIEW Starting this review right off with the build quality  it is definitely quite good for the price  The metal casing and tangle free flat wires are something only very expensive earphones have  so a good thumbs up to BoAt for providing this at such an aggressive price Talking about comfort  i did not like them much honestly  They were decent at best  Neither uncomfortable nor very comfortable  Just manageable Coming to the sound quality  now this is the tricky part Some people will love it  some will hate it Bass is quite good for the price  they are punchy and if you are an EDM fan or love those thumps in every music  this is the one to go with The vocals were simply not good  Because of the extra bass  they get muffled up  So while you will enjoy Badshah ke hiphops  Arijit Singh songs are something you will not really like on these Overall ratings Build     Comfort     Sound Bass      Vocals      Treble     If this review was helpful  please consider marking it helpful    
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The product is really good and the bass is also good  But the sound seems to be loud even in lowest of the volumes  If you make a call and keep it in minimum sound also the voice will be very loud  It caused pain in my ears even for   min  sound stabilization is not done properly  but the build quality is excellent  If you are a person who likes high volume loud bass  you can try it  If you are a person who is sensitive to sound  please do not buy it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought this product on September         And now just after   months its stopped working  The only problem of boat earphones is that they are not at all durable  We want durability  And that is what they are not able to provide  They guarantee that it has a   year warranty but i guess that is all a joke  it is been just   months since i bought this product  And now look  I would never purchase boat again  Jbl and mi earphones are more durable than this product  Disgusting 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Surprisingly poor built quality with the following key pain points   does not connect properly to the phone  You have to try different orientations of the jack and twist and turn the connecting chord to get proper connection else you get sound from the left earpiece   Even when it is properly connected  the right side earpiece volume is higher than the left   The earbuds do not stay firmly on the earpiece and very often the earpiece comes off while the earbud remains lodged in the ear Overall very dissatisfied with the product  The only good part about the product is the case it comes in 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Truly amazing  I do not like to use headphone but I need to attend meeting on webex on frequent basis for more than     hours on an average for the profession I am in  I heard few song and sound quality is awesome  You can clearly hear each of beats in song  Tried with high bass  jazz  etc all sounds just cristal clear  Noise cancellation is not that good because in few instance listner told that they are hearing outter sound  I amalso planning for b t gears as well  Searching right now  Heard good things about Real Me Air pair  let us see Update After   Year Of Use    Suddenly out of working even though my use is decent  No water spills  All of sudden voice is not reaching to listners  I can only use this for hearing Radio Music  Local wired head phone of   rs works for more than     years  Thumbs down to this 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The quality is good  But it stopped working after   and half months  As per warranty  i tried to return but the customer service is pathetic  They told me to get in touch with the vendor in my city  After i contacted him  he was not even interested to speam tk me  He does not even know how to speak to customer   I am trying to speak to him and he keeps cutting the call without letting me finish what i have to say  Its almost like he does not want me to claim my warranty  He just says i should come to the shop for replacement and then he hangs up before i say anything  I called again and he just says one sentence and cuts the call  I am trying to explain that i stay for away from the store  and he is not even listening   There is only one store in Bangalore to claim warranty and that is Banashankari area  I stay near electronic city  He is not even giving me details on what to do after reaching the shop  how long will it take to replace  Nothing   no information at all  As if he is the busiest person on the planet  This is pathetic   I am never going to buy from Boat again  I used to recommend it but now i will not 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  First of all this ear phone does not fit in ear for long time  You have to keep pushing it inside your ears now and then  have to use anti slip buds which is irritating   Sound quality is not good as jbls rs    one   By the way  its not a basshead at all  Idk if they know the meaning of bass  I am telling this because after using lots of earphones  only thing they made right is tangle free  lol   but it does not tangle with my ears  lol  due to its poor design and weight of earpiece  By the way it does its job as they said with less bass 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Boat earphones has never disappointed me and this earphone which I bought is very cool  Starting from the color to the sound quality is to die for The colour attracted me the most  Previously I had this earphones in black color  So this time I thought of buying this in blue colour No complains   Keep it up Boat tuneintonirvana
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Sound quality  noise cancelation is extremely good and the bass drops so hard that you would not believe it But the major flaw with this headphones is that they have added an unnecessary long tube  causing the speaker portion stick out far from your ear  because of which  it keeps falling of out of ears They have included many tools to make it stay in your ears  but still it fails to stay in the ear    I had read this from other reviewers  but I did not think that it was a serious issue  but in fact it was a serious issue I had to think     times before returning it cuz of amazing sound quality  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Product is very very GoodCompare to redmi basic   samsung Esh  This earphones have   ohm impedance   other have   ohm  so what its mean  you can get extra loud sound with half of volume  its also battery saving because you mobile amplifier do not need to give too much signal Now talk about soundSound is balanced  not bass better than redmi basic but definitely better than ESH   QUALITY OF VOCAL   MUSIC IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER EARPHONE  YOU CAN HEAR EVERY INSTRUMENTS SOUND IN THISbut not too much bass  i am not using viper android Call quality best  mic quality is also very good  you do not need to put mic in near mouthBulid quality is little heavy  wire have some weight    but its good for rough handlingSERVICE OR WARENTY CLAIM OF BOAT COMPANY IS EXTREMELY SATISFIED SO YOU do not NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT Because i  already used warrenty claim   replaced my old boat earphone   they replaced  This is My honest review  I love boAt    hope you will be too 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I wanted a wired earphones to attend my meetings since my JBL bluetooth earphones are not good at that  While I was researching for wired earphones  I came across this and felt it could be the one that I am looking for Firstly  the built quality is superb with metallic finish and tangle free cable which is really a good deal at this price  However the sound quality was little low when compared with my JBL earphones which costs Rs            times higher than this  Bass was just okay which I felt can be improved as these earphones were tagged as  bassHeads   Because of the sound quality and bass  I rated a   star If you are looking for a good sound quality with high bass  then I would recommend you to refrain from purchasing this product which will disappoint you for sure  Since I just bought this to attend my meetings and not for any other use  I am not thinking to return this 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  It does not fit in the ear and keeps falling down  earbud is way too heavy  i think due to the metallic body   it irritates you after some time  also if you used bluetooth wireless headphone before then you are going to find it more difficult as cord keeps interfering while you do something or walk and the it keeps coming out   I purchased this as a backup to my bluetooth headphones Sound quality is good though
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am so happy to be a BoAt customer  I think they offer products with a reasonable quality and an EXCELLENT customer service  I have yet to see a company in this country with such an effective and hassle free warranty service  Really  kudos to you guys I had my earphones  mic stop working and I got on their warranty page on their site and things got resolved fairly quickly and painlessly  I particularly want to point out to their thoughtfulness in packaging the new item they sent me  They sent it to me in this packaging  as shown in the image  They sent me this simply packaged unit without the cardboard box and all that the retail unit comes with   As a environment conscious consumer I REALLY REALLY appreciate it  it is particularly a bold move for a company to pull off in a country where eco consciousness is not so prevalent in the general population  Some ignorant consumers may complain about the company being cheap in doing this  but as someone who is concerned about the amount of garbage we generate  I appreciate this move of theirs  I would appreciate it even more if they packaged this using paper instead of plastic  But this is a very thoughtful move on their part nonetheless  esp  in a country like ours 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Just before I start  I have tried this  soundmagic es    cowon em  which are just a     or two more than this  But they sound good for their price  The boat team has compromised heavily with sound quality just to price this a bit cheaper than its competitors  The sound is totally unbalanced to begin with  the bass is just overpowering the vocals  and it is not even good bass  it is muddy and all over the place   Althought the build quality is staunch but I would not compromise it for the sub standard sound quality  do not buy them  please  unless you are okay with horrible sound 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best earphones in this price range  Lookout for offers and discounts as price of this item fluctuates  This is my second buy of this same product  The previous one lasted for   years and one side stopped working impressed  I bought it again Pros Good bass Excellent clear and good sound quality There is a balance between all the sounds Extremely durable flat cable which is tangle free  this comes in handy if you commute by train bus a lot The pause and play button is also of good quality and will last long Can be used for calling as a hands free or for youtubers for recording audio as well It records nice quality audio with good noise cancellation considering its price Additional earbuds make sure that it can be used buy people having either bigger or smaller ears The gold plated     mm jack is also sturdy and well attached with the cable Cons I am not a sound and headphone expert but I feel there is a little distortion above     volume  Its more than enough for regular usage and light gaming as well The only con I would say is that they could have included previous song button alongwith the play pause button  I am not deducting any stars for this one  it is only I wish it had Note  many people say that its heay as its made of metal and falls of often  For that problem they have included the silicon hooks which comes with the box itself you just need to attach thise silicon hooks and they would stick to your ears for eternity 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  what do you expect from earphones   It are not going to make your head a home theatre   it has good bass  sound quality is pretty good  Design is sturdy fits into ear properly  now if you are going to run and jump like a mad buffalo any earphone will fall down irrespective of its design so kindly excuse that   ideal for daily routine use I usually connect with laptop walking track so works for meOverall a decent product with just above average sound quality so yea the boat sails good  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  It is awful to hear from boAt that they are doing cheating on me second time  First I bought a USB cable that was not charging  Secondly  I bought an earphone     wired  But they did it again  I hear the bass in the left one and no bass on the right  It took me some time to get it because I was listening to loud music but a few days ago I noticed when I hear it in mid volume  The music seems just wrong in this earphones  I do not know what to do  But I would never buy boAt product anymore for sure 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  They worked for exactly   monthsI bought the headphones on   th april and by   th august  only one headphone was workingBoth sides of the earphones do not have the little seive inside anymore  as in i can see the speaker base insidet he earphoneThe bass is good for a few weeks buthwn it gets too loudNow  for the right earphone  it works only if i hold ut at a very specific angle   which is not possible because i was using these earphones for gaming and watching videos
Smartdevices,4,OR,  works great  sounds great  high mids all good   nicely tuned   base is also there significant   much better than boult or ant audio  mic works well   although new versions are less durable as my old ones are stronger than the new one s  this one  i bought for my dad  Clearly  there are some compromises being made while price increased  So for no noise cancellation and low value for money it stops from being perfect but still lies in considerate lineup especially compared to competition 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  If you look a pair of cheap good earphone as daily driver and rough usage  no wonder it DID cross your eyes Me  As Introduction I have a history with with CX     Piston    Rock Zircon in the past  And here goes my review for  boAt Bass Heads     In Ear Bass Headphones  Pros   Sturdy build quality  Hands down one of the best part of this earphone   The metal and hard plastic finished capsule and the cable are fitted well enough to carry along with you to their work  jogging  travelling etc   A pleasant to look at it  I got the red one for me and yes it looks awesome and premium  it stands out quite enough   Price Sound quality ratio  is justified   I was a bit skeptical over The title on the box  Super EXTRAAAA Bass  as I do not like  too much bass  destroying  every other notes of the song music  But the slight rumbling  extended bass delivered impressed me   IDK if its for  Bassheads  but its definitely not for flat listeners   Soundstage is a bit below average   The mids and the treble area are straight forward muddy  it does not have the sharpness there   and the identification of individual instruments are muffled  Overall I would give the sound quality a positive sign obviously  considering the price   The single Pause Play button is embedded into the microphone chasis  so like the entire plastic body part is a  switch  you do not have search for the switch with your thumb   And thumbs up for the L shaped    mm jack   Lastly  The packing is good  Expect a carrying pouch we get   sets of Black earbuds    sells of Red transparent earbuds   A clip  Pair of clamp  to support into ear    Using the black earbuds might provide you a little more comfort but I found the sound gets muffled a bitCons  Now sadly from here on in my review  everything goes downhill upto a really deal breaking point   Its UNCOMFORTABLE     it hurts badly in my ear  No matter what earbuds I tried  with or without the clamp or  the clip  it hurts   Specially when you are on the go  because of its long heavy metallic body of the earpieces   Ok this experience should not be generalized  as some people out there might find a particular setup to achieve the proper  isolation  fit and comfort  but not me  And I can not recommend this product in that regard   Isolation inside ear is poor  and as it hurts you can not put it into ear for long period also   The microphone is bad  you always have to keep it close to your mouth even in a relatively less noisy condition   And no volume rocker   The Tangle free wire is really tangle free but how it feels against the skin  specially when sweaty  is not as comfy as  the braided cable  Its a matter of choice what you like  personally I like the fabric textured braided cable over thisAlready sold this to a friend  nd hand  So no further updates Iif anyone is off to look for something else I would recommend checking  Remax RM    D   Yes aesthetically and in build quality it might not be in a same level as this one but it has volume rocker  Way better sound signature and comfortable fit in similar price bracket 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  These earphones also get really loud but will only appeal to a certain set of buyers  If you are a basshead who enjoys a thump in your music  these earphones are good for the price they command  If you prefer a neutral or a bright sound  these are not for you ProsExcellent build qualityBundled earhooksCan get loudConsOversensitive microphoneBass overpowers mids and highsRatings  out of   Design  comfort   Audio quality     Value for money     Overall     
Smartdevices,5,OR,  HIGHLY DURABLE   I bought this product on    November      and have been using it since then It just stopped working today on    August       Reordered the same one again Pros   Quality of material is really amazing and high premium quality wire  Extra ears buds in various sizes as an extra accessories feels really soft to ears which is good for long hours usage without any irritation  feels very comfortable Amazing base beats  great and powerful output sound quality Tangle free wire in flat shaped that is another great feature Head set cups made of metals for amazing performance and longer durabilityCons  Driver unit is a little bit heavy But for me it does not create a problem because I have used this product for more than   year  Vocal could be more clear My overall opinion This product is durable and      worth the money
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this headphone  th  june      but after     months its stop working then i call service center for replacement and file a complain Then after few days i submit the falty headphone to their delivary boy   after   days they give me a new one it is working properly but after     months in   th july      it was stop working again but this time i did not claim replacement because warranty period is over this is why i do not think it is a good product exept this it is a good product in a affordable price  for     months i think this is why it is a wast of money 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Today is   nd September       and i bought boat earphones just one year back in September  As per the price  the earphone is great  But it will not last long  I faced problems since last two months and now the day before yesterday both sides of earphone has gone shut  Its not working anymore  As i said relatively to this price it went well in the start  Only for short time 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Firstly the built quality is top notch love the tangle free design cable and L shaped jack coming to the sound is where i was a little disappointed the quality of bass and overall sound was noticeably lacking   But for this orice range i can not asl for much its mediocre sounding not too bad not great either   Good for people who just like balanced sound stage  Mic quality was superb took some calls no complaints whatsoever   I would say overall a descent product for r its price   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Got this from sale for     bucks Cons    Wire is too thick  Although its tangle free but it your ears will feel the weight of wires when you are using this headphones while walking  Feels like it will just come out and you end up in sliding it into your ears now and then    Sound quality is best at low volumes  At high volumes you do not hear beats clearly  Listening this ear phones at high volumes is not recommended unless you care for your ears   Microphone is one of the worst  You literally end up swallowing the microphone for other end to listen your voicePros   tangle free wires   good quality material
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Very crisp sound mids nd low r good but high is bad  overall quality its good   wire quality is good  but not comfortable with  earhooks  without earhooks earphones keep falling  and i think its due to bad placement of wire connectivity outside the earphones      And THIS IS AN HONEST OPINION   In terms of enjoying a music  i think comfort in earphones is necessary as the sound quality  so in both these departments i think Mi earphones rs      is a clear winner   but only con is wire quality of mi earphones r nit as good as boat bass heads              So after all its ur choice       My choice is mi earphones   Gd luck 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  product is absolutely awesome when it comes to music and bass  What I did not like was that there is no volume up and down option available and also the weight of the earphones are slightly on the higher side because the set up is made of metal  Right and left are not highlighted but written in the same color of the earphone which made it difficult to identify  The mic side is left which we should always bear in mind  Overall good but volume up and down is a key feature which this misses on lastly its a Made in China product which I am ashamed to see now 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This headphones does not last for a month also  the one code stopped working     days back and now the second one is also losing it sound  I purchased this headphones on   nd jul      and today being the   nd Aug       Just a one month I am totally disappointed with this product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Though expectations should not be high from a low priced earphone  these have good sound specially bass  The flat wire is not as good as HTC which first introduce flat type wires so that they do not get entagled but still works  Major grouse was the fitment  i ordered these for children in the house and after trying all bud types thry still did not fit well  realised that the earphone housing itself is fairly wide 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this product one year ago    I did not face any problem till it was under warrenty   and after   yr right side stop working and i was upset about it   and again after   days left side also stopped working    Now its a waste product for me    Firstly the product was good in terms of bass and sound quality but if the earphones is not working the for everyone its a waste      So buyers be careful while buying    For first few months you will not face any problem but after it you will regrate about it     And its all upto you    Thnk you
Smartdevices,3,OR,  let us get inPros     Treble          very suppressed trebles     Bass           it is a very over powering bass    please do understand difference between bass and loudness    Mids         wire quality is good   earphones she will are of some cheap metal alloy  well loudness is there to this    dB means a lot actually   for the bass people here the bass is good but it is not rich what that means is there is no clean bass it is a mix of mids and bassCons    Left Earphones die like that   experienced n seen for   such earphones that include mine and friends    Buttons malfunction at times Not for the guys who want to listen acoustic and natural equilised music it turns every lower Hz to almost full bar so it steals the real clarity  Go for it if you want it for a casual listening not a precise sound output as it will not give you one
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am reviewing this product after     years of usage so just stay on with mePROS  Sound quality is very good even after so many days it sounds like the original one The TANGLE FREE cable keeps its promise  does not tangle at all unless you seriously take it a challenge XD The build quality is good  has not developed any crack or other issues  The various ear buds provided helps you select the most comfortable one for your ear The metallic buds are quite relevantCONS  First of all the colour will fade after   years of continuous usage kind of looks dull afterwards The Yellow colour is conspicuous yet gets dirty easily and there is no remedy unless you consider dry washing as an option  lol OVERALL NICE PRODUCT NO COMPLAINTS
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Superrrrrrbbbb Headphone Frm BOAT  Very Premium Build Quality  Bass Is So Osm    Feels Like A Dj Home Theatre Experience   Pros  Best Build Quality Wid Metallic Finish Flat Tangle Free Cable High Boom Bass  L  Shape Gold Plated Connector For Durability Loud Sound   Clear Vocals Easy   Fitt In Ear   Pairs Of Extra Ear Buds   Cons  No Earphone Carrying Case Include With Dis Pack Afterall    It Is A Best Valuable Earphone In This Price Range  Really  I Got Surprised After Listening Music Frm This Earphone  you Can Go For Itt   Without Any Confusion  Thnx Amazon For Fast Delivery  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This is  nd Boat     I owned I used JBL headphones in between  but lost it apparently Unless you use some good brand like JBL you do not know why Boat headphones are not good The build quality in Boat headphones is good and sturdy  But it is really bad on User experience The headphones fall off from ears oftenIt is very heavyThe long cable is really annoying  nobody needs such long cable The sound quality is average to good  but the bass is again unnecessarily high  but vocals are not  no sound eqalizer can fix it enough So go for JBL headphones in same budget instead of these 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  At this price range this is the best product for bass lovers its wired one so no charging  and discharging  worries   its comes with   year warranty with warranty  card inside the box  Its comfortable on your ears for   hours  personal experience  after that you will experience little pain  overall good music experience  with this earphones just be aware of the fake product  You can watch videos on you tube to differentiate  between original and fake product  I did that so I know the difference i wanted everyone who r buying these earphones  should  get original  product  and good music  experience  Bass       Comfort      Durability       Tangle free cable yes
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I am reviewing this product after   months  I really liked the sound quality of it when I purchased it at first  but as time passed  the constant issue of adjusting the earbud drove me crazy  It is too heavy and keeps sliding off your ears and trust me  those ear supports do not work as they are extremely painful  slip off when you are running and you cannot listen to them while sleeping on your side  The most important thing is the durability which sucks as one of my earbuds stopped working after   months and I cannot claim my warranty as I have lost my card  The sound quality is extremely good and one of the best if you like great bass  It kind of distorts the beauty of old melodious songs  however  It is a good choice if you prefer listening in a rested position  Make sure to retain all the contents of the original box 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Amazing product  I love loud music and I have tried many headsets  This is a high quality product  Loudness is very high  Bass is very tight and punchy  Terrible is good  The product feels robust  Time will tell the durability  but certainly feels like it will last a long time  No need to buy foreign brands anymore  Though this is Indian company I am a bit disappointed that the product is designed in USA and manufactured in China  not India  This can be compared to jbl or higher 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Nice earphone and nice bass and voice ckearity for that price in wired earphone  Boat had best after sales service  I got my earphone replaced in time  It got jack problem as I was using it in workout time  It got pulled and volume starts automatically lowering and one earpiece stopped working  But till the end of year they replaced it  I also had JBL with my brother which did not stand even for a week the rough usage  I am happy I just canceled the ordered JBL and gone for boat 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Been using these for more than six months  The sound quality is good but they are very poorly designed in terms of ergonomics  The earphones keep falling off from ears every few minutes  Yes  I tried using all the extra buds in the package   that is just not for me  I have a couple of people in my family who use these and have the same issue If you are going to buy them to use while jogging or running  they are pretty useless My verdict  Do yourself a favor and skip these 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Though the sound quality is good  not comfortable at all  Very heavy  after couple of minutes it irritates you  Not suitable  if you are planning to watch movie or not even for phone calls  I tried JBL  Sony  Sennheiser  Boat in ear headphones  but personally I like Sony and JBL only 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This was very initial impressions ill update this review later or follow me Bass was excellent amazingAnd all other sounds unable to say but they are average or above average as said this is initial impressionsI am using LG G  thinQ so volume is treated as    is full when i exceed    this earphones distort heavily and can not be used at high level but at    i am ok with it it definitely distort at higher volumes but you will nit use at higher volumes bcoz it satisfies your hearing at     to     only  after all the bass vocals mids and treble goes digitally high and distort its not good to hear tooAnd it has passive noise cancellation tooMostly this earphones depends on quality output of    mm audio jack for my lg g  it has quad dac so its the beast of powering any headphone in the market
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Just a beast      Being a music producer  I have tried to extend its level for the fullest I have tried to mix and master out many songs with it    and VOILA      they sounded so real    Each and every frequency could be heard  Which is not expected at this price rangeIt s just     do not know what to say    I have Sennheiser professional headphones which cost me         I monitored both and there was not much difference A must buy thing on amazon  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I had initially received a damaged product and amazon replaced it without hassle  The packaging is neat and compact  comes with all the   sizes of earbuds in two colours so you get a total of   pairs of them The product in itself is decent and worth the price paid  Now we can not expect the bass and noise cancellation of the high end over the ear headphones that cost at least   x more  The button at the mouthpiece starts and stops music and disconnects calls efficiently  The flat cord ensures that you do not tangle the headphones as much as you otherwise would have  it is a huge pro for me because I personally suck at untangling wires   It overall looks and performs way better than the other earphones at this price point  So if your budget is under       I would suggest you get these without hesitation 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am writing this review after using this earphones for   year  It was working well for   year and   month one side earpiece stopped working and I can not able to claim warranty also but that   year it is working quiet well and the bass is also soooo good actually I am a bass lover so only I bought this earphones  it is a good earphones to buy I am not saying that it will stop working after   year my friends are using it still now   to   year it is life vary on the way how you handle it that is it then after that I bought boAt rockerz     on ear headphones and it is also working quiet will and the bass is killing good at full volume your ear will  start to vibrate  I think I am writing two products reviews in one place  lol        Have a niceday       
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have bought   pairs   one for me and   other for colleagues Even today one of my colleague ordered one   sound quality is good and it has a tanglefree flat cord which is its USP
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I can say its a Average headset  the headset package was already opened when i got it  I took a risk and tried the headset  Some one might have returned it since the Sound and Bass is not up to the mark Pros     Headset wire is flat which makes it tangle free and long lasting Cons        I find the ear bud hard to put in  also it keeps on falling  only the small buds was suitable for me but it also keeps falling if you try to get up or move around I would recommend seeing Sameer patil user review which is in the top    before buying this since each user have their own need 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  How misleading can the name of this item be  for there is hardly any bass at all  Its very disappointing  There is not even a return policy on this  I have just wasted my money 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Ear plug is not fit in ears  Again and again it comes out from ear  I tried other size of given plug in cover  But no luck  None of them fit properly  So  not for work out of course Sound quality is not bad  But main problem it is not stable when you will wear in ear  So I am not happy with this product I used sony  schenizer  none of them I did not face such issue  But bot disappointed me My personal opinion do not go for this  If you want I will request please check the issue what I have faced 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  If you are a Electronic Music lover   Then i recommend Skullcany jib versions  Boat does not deliver the promised bass   Audio have too much  treble makes it sound unclear at times and hurts ears even at lower volume due to high frequencies   After using Skullcany for   years now i never faced any problems like this   The ear buds sometimes block the audio in boat    Only the build quality is good over skullcandy and rest of the elements   Skullcandy is the best   Delivers excellent bass and audio clarity and quality   Without hurting ears at louder volume and ear bud fit well I myself edm Producer so i know how it should sound like   But if you are someone who listens to music less often but uses only for calls then its goodHope this helps thank you
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The product i received was packed very nicely ro avoid any damages to item Now let us talk about earphonesBoat     model is quite nice when we talk about bass in silent room but when you are traveling these headphones does not work on same setting you need to increase the volume almost to make to have clear cut audio experience plus the earphones does not stuck in ear which is new issue Though if you are not a regular traveller like me you will not feel any issue Best for normal usage or budget issues 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The overall build quality is excellent  It will not tangle and because that irritation  Wires are thick enough and it will not get damaged due to any accidental stretch The loudness is good and music gets crisp and clear  Though bass is low  One might need to configure the Equaliser  If one listens to various genres of music then this setting will not help In this price segment it is still the best choice  One gets various buds to fit in the ear and a pair of ear holder as well The packaging done by Amazon was good and it had no damages 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Sound is clear and loud Bass is superb  Sometimes feel Bass is too high Cable is tangle free Case is good quality Noise in earphone mic is too high Metal should be of less weight as left earpiece falls too frequently which is annoying  Last in ear for about       secs max  Medium sized earbuds suits me Earbuds are hard which gives ear pain and not comfortable to wear for long time Buy a light weight earphone instead of these Not satisfied with the purchase 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using this Headphone since long Intitially ordered this during        Consinuously used this on daily basis for more than   years and then it started malfunctioning earlier  I had used headsphones of other reputed brands  but  this only withstand long rough usage on daily basis   I have again ordered the same model      since I am hugely satisfied with the performance and durability Pros Ear Pods are of Metal   Ensuring DurabilityFlat Cable  Tangle Free OperationBass          at this price range Sound Clarity      Cons Ear Pods are a bit heavy  since metalicCable length is loo long  sometimes  hard to manage such long lengthif we ignore these smalls cons  reast everything is simply superb Just use it for once  it will make you a repeat purchaser   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  They are good and as promised the bass is strong but that is it about them  if you are into EDM and Beats then they are perfect for you but if you are into Instrumental or listen to Vocals like me  then I would not really recommended theseAlso I personally enjoy short music session for like   min and I did find them uncomfortable within that bracket I would not recommended these for prolonged sessionsBut otherwise they are loud enough  no complaints there  I only wished they sounded more clear
Smartdevices,5,OR,    The Audio quality of these headphones is really good compares to others in this price range  Boat promised what they say out of box  Extraaaa Bass    the Bass of these headphones are really high compared to others  An overall the sound output of this headphones are very high    I found these headphones have good audio quality compare to others at this price   If you like EDM and pop songs  then you love these Boat headphones  But I suggest reducing a volume of your phone while listening Sufi and romantic songs because by default these headphones have higher volume  so you do not feel clear audio   The once again Bass effect is really good with treble and vocal  You can easily distinguish between different instruments   sounds which are good for extra bassy headphones After review and comparison with other headphones  I say the Boat boAt BassHeads                 is the best headphones in price comparison  It has a solid build quality  good performance  low price  and more important extreme Bass  I highly recommend these headphones for Bass lovers   budget conscious people who are looking for high quality   durable earphones at a reasonable price 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Everything is good  Actually excellent  Sound is crisp and lows are good  bass   Just one improvement needed is that the ear buds are some tough  can not it be some soft  It sometimes slips off the ear due to less suction power  Soft buds have more suction  I mean they are a little uncomfortable  Otherwise the product is just above its level  Best in this segment  If you are planning for an earphone from          go for it blindly 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Bought them for     INRBoat bassheads are ones that i bought for my friends i bought two of them and tested them beforehand Following were the best of this Powerful bass Crisp Sound Little bit Surround Sound And Balanced audio even after powerful bassIf you have buget go for them But If they are around     INR Try JBL C    or C    one with the same price    During Offers 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  All is okay  I guess I do not like how bulky they are in the ear  They do not sit in my ear Edit  These lasted  They worked for    years before the right side went mute  I have used them almost everyday for     hours depending on the load Final verdict  they are good  not the best but worth the money  I will recommend them because they have the mic at the right spot  you do not have to hold it up because it is attached just a little below your left earphone  most mics are attached at the place where the left and right meet I have dealt with the bulky and weighty issue by looping it around my ear  that way it sat comfortably in my ear even for a walk If it fits your budget buy it I will buy another one from boat now  P
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The boat has established and proved itself as a promising and reliable Indian brand  It has launched some very affordable as well as very well built products lately  These earphones are no joke either  The very first thing I liked about these earphones is the build  The cable is flat and made of good quality rubber material  Earphones are metallic and are heavy thus feel very sturdy and durable  Also  the sound is very good  It has got superb Bass  and equally good trebles   vocals  These are cheaper compared to other expensive and reputed brands and even then it maintains an impressive balance between build and sound quality  It has even got a Mic and call pick drop button which is a bonus at this price  Compared to the Sennheiser s CX     which has no Mic button and very cheap built  and JBL s C   si  average build and Little expensive   these are a much better option 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The boat bassheads     has good built quality as well as very rich sound quality  Due to the   mm audio drivers the bass is good at high volumes The company claims that the    m flat cable is tangled free and have sogle button for controls which means it is unable to control volume levels  The ear piece is made of metal which give rich feeling whereas make it a bit heavy and after long usage it is a bit painfull  Is such a price range it is a great deal and specially for people looking high bass   The product is value for the money spent on it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  boAt Bass Heads     in Ear Bass Headphones with One Button Mic  Red    It come in many colors including vibrant red  It has really nice sound quality and good bass  It is equally good for listening to music from youtube or gaana or wink music  Also it is equally effective with telephonic calls or official teleconferences  I connect it with my mobile to listen to music or while watching movies through Netflix  or Prime Video  or Google Movies  Also I use it to connect to my office laptop for taking calls during meetings  I highly recommend one to use this product as it is versatile and delivers what it promises 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The built quality of the earphone is amazing as per the price  If you are an EDM lover and listen to rock music then I highly recommend you to buy this  But  if you love to listen to songs with vocals then this might disappoint you a bit not completely because it sounds better than most of the  k earphones I bought the blue colour and it looks awesome my brothet has the red one    So  you can choose either of them and look cool   that is all   thanks for reading  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is the second time i am buying this headset  superb bass  excellent build quality and tangle free wire  i have dropped it so many times  the head is metal  my previous headset still works fine if you are looking for headset in this price range  this is the best one for you  better than jbl c    The only problem you might face would be the pin     mm  would become loose after frequent use
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Have been using it for over seven months now Likes    It provides good sound quality    Bass is great    Noise cancellation is also great Dislikes The earbuds  None of the sizes were right for my ears  They are too big and keeps popping off my ears  The worst being that I cannot use a smaller earbud too as the design is customised  Other earbuds do not fit in this earphones 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Seriously do not buy this   It was actually good for like   months and after that boom   side stops working   Then I sent it to the boat guys as it was under warranty and they replaced it and btw it took   weeks to replace so its waste of time and energy   The replaced product that they have also stopped working after   day and I sent it back to them again fyi they took   month to replace this during that time I had bought Sony s headphones they are much more reliable   So the third earphone that I received also stopped working after   months wow by this time I was fed up and threw them in the trash   ps where they belong     So ya please consider boat if you want a product without any reliability  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The product as the name says  is bass heavy  Thise who loves bass would totally love these headphones  The overall sound quality  especially treble and mids are a bit weak  but that is because its bass heavy So  if you are more interested in bassy output and do not care much about other things  do go for it The built quality is kind of good  but the metal casing does feel a bit heavy in ears  The flat cables are great as they are a bit thick and does not tangle a lot  However  despite the good built quality  mine did not last for more than   months 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This may be a problem with not just this earphone but all boAt earphones  Till they work  they work fine  But if there is any problem  well  you are on your own  The is no after sales customer support I had another boAt earphone which worked fine for about six months  Then it started giving problem  I tried their service centre  but they were not really helpful  Any way I was happy with the sound quality so decided to give it another chance thinking that may be my earlier piece was defective  This time it lasted longer  but same problem again  One side simply stopped working  As far as after sales customer support is considered  there does not seem to be any improvement  Even after a month of registering my complaint  I have yet to receive any communication from them 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I am writing this review after using it for   months  The boat bass heads is too loud for the ears sometimes you can feel the pain in your ears because of it is metal ear buds I am highly dissatisfied with the microphone people who are on the other can not even hear properly what I am speaking I need to bring them direct near my mouth so that it becomes audible Actually I wanted to returned it  but alas their was no return option can anyone help me in returning it so that I can get a new one Bass    Looks    Treble    Overall      
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The pros are  Cheap Durability Almost tangle free cable Clicky switches MicThe cons are  Disturbing loudness Biased towards highs Mids and lows are ok but not good  Uncomfortable earbuds  Not good for long useIt s better to pick something like Sennheiser CX     or Audio Technica ATH COR   ISLG if you want good sound quality
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The product is original and it is the exact colour and brand but the thing is it is not worth buying  The headphones started making trouble in just     weeks  I can not talk and use other apps it will automatically disconnect and the call will become like loud speaker  And the sound quality is good  You can use it to watch Netflix or Amazon prime but not good for calls and other purpose  I felt like simply waste  If you want for call purpose please do got for other brand 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The sound quality is quite fine  The mid  bass and lows are balanced enough and sound clarity is good  Only one issue I found is the earpiece   earbud shape and size  it has the habit of falling off  The lengthof the cable too is on bit longer side  Have tried many earphones  both cheap and costlier ones  this oneis better one of them at this price point  Bought Ant Audio W   wired earphone too along with this one and found Ant Audio was bit better 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  With price range it is an excellent buy  The only con which I faced is get the correct ear tip  as body is made of metal it is quite heavy and always tend to come out of the ear  but we get   pairs of extra ear tips  The problem usually will come if you r travelling or when you r jogging  so better use the wing tip so tat it remains  planted in ear Rest all the other things seems excellent   quality of built  performance 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Love this headphone Bought the headphone fory brother  for gaming   But after using     mo  there is an issue created with jack  Causing frequently disconnection and one side sound I contacted their customer care  via email  and told the issue Surprisingly they arranged a pickup for the product  as I am residing far from service center   After reaching they replaced the product and sent it via courier Top class service from them  and this is expected in this rough time Keep up the good work BOAT  We love you 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Not worth the money  I have been using these earphones for more than   months now  So  however the earphones are not that bad in sound and built quality  but I could not get a good piece of earphones even after   replacements First thing  they are not compatible with all android phones  so do check the compatibility before buying Second thing  In my first delivery  i got a damaged piece in which mike was not working  so I got them replaced  after using them for   months  mike of this pair has also stopped working third thing  they keep falling off your ears  May be because earphones are heavy as they are made of metal   so if you are a sort of person who bangs his head while listening to your favorite music  these are not for you  they fall off with slightest jerk in wire 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Great Sound but they keep falling off  hence   Stars Pros          Great Sound  no two ways about it  Lovely sound and noise cancellation effects    length of the wire is goodCons          Keeps falling off   balance is off  Weight of the Earphones and weight of the wire pincher with the BOAT logo is heavy and they pulling the earphone down    The small handle projections at the base of the earphone from where the wire comes out are projected outwards which pulls it down as well    Esp  when you are walking and running the earphones will fall off  only good for listening while you are static and do not move your head    Not fully tangle free  in spite of the flat wires  they get tangled sometimes
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Bought it in January  received a already opened box so thought of replacing it but next time got detective product as I was buying it with cashback offer ao did not returned it instead of I contacted Boat via email and they pocked it up after   days and I received a brand new product and it was fantastic   Lows mids were awesome and clear even at very low volume  Using it for almost  months and I can say it is build quality will surprise you  Though I purchased it for Rs      Rs     model  it got a great deal bit If you buy it even for     you will not be disappointed  Thank you Boat
Smartdevices,3,OR,  This headset is not so great at the same time not poor also   sound quality is really good but when put it in my ear I feel the rough surface of headset is little annoying   and not feel the comfort level as I compare it the Skullcandy headset I never faced any such things and more over I bought this boat for my voice recording in smile plat form but after recording the voice am very disappointed    as compare to Skullcandy its much much better than this     anyway no point in talking about voice recording   as these are meant for listening music   if you are only going to use it for music then big thumbs up   but see the comfort level for your ears   
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I ordered this headphones reading the reviews  I received promt delivery however i used this for an hour of opening the box and noticed that the sound of left earbud was slightly lower then the right  I checked the same on sound meter as well and meter showed   decibel difference in both headphones  However no review says this problem  Might be this one off case or this lot may have this problem  I returned the product on the same day  Hope Boat will solve this problem  I was not expecting much sound quality for this budget but can not stand sound difference in left and right earbud 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Packing was great and as mentioned all things were there within box the earphones have good Sound quality andBetter Noise cancellation but After    days of use the earphone was working properly but the mic was not working properly as whenever i used to contact with others while using this earphone the reciever receives rusty noise while taking  then i tested with other earphones they were working well So buying this product was just waste of money for me  insted i has to buy a local earphone which is still working properly 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I have used Sennheiser cx     and jbl c   si And i bought this budget friendly now Pros  low price   year warranty does not distort at full volume it will fall from ears  but not if you wear ear wings or hooks Cons  at       volume bass mixes into vocals too much you must put it at    Percent volume for enough performance bass is coming when not needed too overrated build quality seems ok  but packaging box is too small that when you open this headset you will see many bands and curves in wire which are unable to readjust  because of these curves and band big possibility pf breakage from jack  it feels cheap  cannot deliver even lil bit surround sound you will feel exhausted after long time or at high volume  not so comfortable  Comparison Cx    is best for best balanced sound Jbl c   si is better in bass than cx     and bass quality is not cheap like boat Both these are better than boat so far I suggest do not buy this boat or any boat headset  better if you want quality sound then buy cx     or want balanced bass then jbl c   si Sennheiser is too comfortable   and durable Jbl c   si is comfortable also   but not as cx      Also with mic headset does not last so long compared to without muc headset  So go for without mic handsfree if it is not needed If your budget is higher buy Sony xb   which will cost           in offer 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  You should totally go for this product  It has an amazing sound quality and works well with my Redmi phone Pros     The design is quite good and the wires does not get tangled    Microphone works well    Comes up with a Carrying case and some extra earbuds in case you lose one    One thing I would like to point out if you listen to music alot and did not know is that  while listening to some music on your phone  if you press the mic one time  the music stops  again press it and the song resumes playing  if you press it two times  then the next song starts playing  and if you press it   times  the previous song gets played  it is a nice feature if you are multi tasking and listening to music  No need for opening the phone screen  just do as I have said for changing music Cons  None that I can think of P  S    kudos to the Amazon team and workers for working in this lockdown situation  We all really appreciate your efforts  Thank you 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Sound quality is ok I have noticed the following down points    The quality of the material is not good  it is not friction proof  every time due to friction with shirt or cloth the earphone come out of the ear   The material used for making the wire is quite heavy and because of it is weight the earphone pulls out of the ears   The wire of the earphone is quite big and it is become difficult to adjust the same    Due to it is build quality and lengthy wire it is become very uncomfortable to wear the earphone and every time you have to adjust the earpiece And one more thing the cable is not Tangle FreeOVER ALL ITS CHEAP AT THIS PRICE  BUT POOR ON COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE AND WILL CERTAINLY DISTURB UR LIFESTYLE
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it is been  yrs since purchased  Still boom sound as I maintain my accessories with care  Sound quality is just exceptional for the price range  I wear them upside down with the help of the provided clip for ample comfort  I do not use earhooks  Bass is solid   thumping  does not feel any dampness or amplification at any volume level  Just pure thumping sound One thing that I wished is that I should be able to use them while resting  They are just fine in as long as I am sitting or walking  but while resting  they tend to create discomfort even in the upside down position inserted in the ears    only due to this reason  I sometimes begin searching for other earphones  While writing this review  I have favourited Sennheiser C   s in my wish list  so thought to express my feelings for Boat Bassheads     too 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Earphone will give you extra sound if wire will shake    and always you have to push earphone into ear as it will slip out after some time very irritating not comfortable as well  So go for which ease your ear  think too much as its     bucks  Material is some what not tempting but sound will win over it  Go for it I have purchased   unit
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Not much to say except they work great  quality is good  Nothing I can really complain about  Reasonable price for such a great sound  Loving every minute I am listening to something in these  I have not bought a lot of high end  high price  in ear headphones  but this one is far   away the best I have ever heard and owned  And the price makes it a fantastic value  and no  I am not a  bot  or associated with BOAT   just a very satisfied customer   your mileage may vary  I have not owned it long enough to comment on durability  but am extremely pleased with it so far  Very comfy  can not really tell I have them in  They seem to slip out a little when I am outside in the heat  My guess it is because of the sweat I highly recommend this product   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Although sound quality is good  balanced bass  decent wire quality  but it has quality isse  Earpieces are metallic which makes heavy as result it does not stay in my ear while I walking  jogging  driving  Earpiece keep falling from earphone  I get pain in my ear due ti heaviness od metallic body lastly I returned the product   got refunded 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Received the earphone in good condition Got this in a deal and is definitely worth the bucks One problem is that it is too loud and causes pain after using it for a time 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The earphone just arrived and I was astonished by the packaging and quality of the product  The packaging is really very good  It will not let you feel about the low price of the product Previously  I always used to prefer Sony earphones only  My last one was MDR XB   which is a very expensive one  But the sound quality was good enough to make you feel proud about the money spent on them  Undoubtedly  my ears are habituated to quality sound and bass output  The Sony earphone is not working right now and I am a bit out of budget for an expensive alternative  After days of research and analysis  I took a risk and gave BOAT     Bass Heads a shot After connecting it to my phone I was utterly mesmerised by the sound quality it is offering at this price point  Trust me  I am a bit sceptical about these things  The price is too low to be compared to other high quality earphones out there in the market  The bass output is awesome  The highs are not that well balanced but considering the price  it is just an awesome product  The build quality is great and you can not expect more  it is true that the earphones are heavy and will tend to come out  The ear tips provided with the earphones are very hard and not at all comfortable  My previous ear tips from Sony came handy in this situation  Thus  I am saved  P Nevertheless  I would definitely recommend these earphones if you love bass and have really very low budget like me 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good bass in this model if you are bass lover than go for it But highs   lows are not that good plus vocals are also not crystal clear so make ur decision According to that Rather build quality is superb comes with metal housing   flat style tangle free cable so that is an advantage Also in box we got ear support clips   extra ear buds so you can install them according to your ear size I hope you like my review feel free to ask any questions 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I purchased this earphone in the month of March       today its almost   year and trust me the sound Quality is as awesome as it was on the day one   We are buying this gadget because we want to feel the real sound  we want to get isolated from other things and trust me kuch sunayi nahi deta isko lagaane ke bad Total noice cancellation    No  Of times i dropped mis handelled my earphone but the build quality is so good you do not have to worry about   I am using it in my Mobile Laptop PC Home Theatre     outletThank you  Buy it 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I do not understand why people buy these  Thesr hurt a lot when put in ear  Also  probably most of the people who bought and reviewed it   star have not heard what real bass is  I would recommend everyone to buy Panasonic s     earphones which do way way more justice to the price  In fact those have been my favourites since       I have used two before and after listening to these so called bassheads  I returned these and re ordered Panasonic and Oh God  The sound quality still stands out 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Note Totaly unbiased opinion Used both of them before if you want earphone for bass only then you can go for boat bassheads      realme is just behind boat but for overall sound quality go for realmeUsed boat before definitely have to face problem in its comfortBASSBoat        realme       realme bass thumping feels good but not as high as that of boat SOUND QUALITYBoat        Realme       Realme all things are good balancedCOMFORTBoat       Realme       when use Boat for long duration it creates headache DURABILITYBoat      Realme       Boat gets an advance of l shaped connector which makes it more durable Wire quality of realme is better than that of boat In my opinion you should go for realme buds  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Simple and straight forward review   Good earphone in terms of sound and bass  Looks strong and has Flat cable  Pin connector is good and will not come out  Noise isolation is decent enough and please do not expect anything more in this price from any earphone  it does the required jobThe onyl issues   The earplugs are lil bulky only on very long use may be since it is made of metal  the earplugs will fall down easily while in use with some preasure on wires which is going to be obvious when you are using and doing some task  if you order Black ones  they will have green finish on earplugs and holder like in the phito attachedOtherwise  it is a great earphone in terms of use  And do not get confused between     vs      they both are same and only difference is one is sold on Amazon while other on Flipkart 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Pros    Great to work with if you are stationary  like working on a PC    Good sound quality as per price Rupees           Good build quality sturdy and tangle free  flat cable  Hence no breaks at joints    Includes extra ear buds and ear lob supporters Cons    Very heavy and tends to slip out of ear    If you are casually moving  they slip    Not at all for runners 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Super fast delivery by Amazon  Received package in excellent condition  As for the headphones  it is absolutely mind blowing  The sound output is just awesome  The Crystal clear sound with extra bass is just super  The package also contains extra earbuds and a clip  Design wise this headphone is light weight and has flat tangle free cable which makes it extremely durable  I am extremely happy with this and I am loving it 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Sach batavu to bass ekdm best he or sound quality bhi a  i he thoda surround quality means  D effects type thoda kam hai isme or ekdm bekar chiz iski ke iske earbuds metal ke he isliye ye bahut heavy  bhaari  hone ki vajah se baar baar ear   kaan  mese niche gir jaata he to ye itna irritate karta hena itna gussa aata hena ki mat pu o baat dusre bahut sare uske earbuds ke aage ka bhi bahut change krke bhi dekhe alag alag size ke fir bhi ye heavy weight metal ki vajah se gir hi jaate he or ye kisiko bike pe use krna hoto bike pe to jara bhi nahi tikte uspe kuchh rumal jesa ku  aage lagavo tohi raheta he varna ye gir hi jaata he or ye thoda fast walking me or jogging me to jara bhi nahi tikte baar baar gir hi jaate  he  or dusra ki iski mic ki quality bhi thodi thik he mic ki capturing distance sound bhi kam hai or sound bhi thoda different kar deta he mene ise call pe bhi use kiya to bahut logo ne kaha ki tumhari voice thodi alg si aa rahi he fir mene ye earphone nikal ke baat kru to ekdm thik se aati he isliye ye bhi thoda con he vese normal he par ye do   con   kami  he isme varna iska sound volume level output to bahut a  a he    or mene black colour ke order kiye the vese ye black hi aaye he but uska slide colour green metel type hai   bas varna ise sirf baas or sound output level ko sun na hoto achhe he 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent product under less price      What i liked   Sound quality is excellent  felt like am near to home theatre system while watching movie or listening to music  Even call quality is also soo good   The material is soo premium  no need worry of any wire issue  What else i can expect   The product is coming With one year warranty from the manufacturer   
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I have bought these earphones on Diwali sale at     rupees but I am not satisfied with it because it does not fit in my ears even not in anyone elses The main problem is that the portion that fits into ears are made up of metal so because it is heavy it does not fit in ears  so because of these problems of their customers they are providing some rubber adjustment that help it to fix into ears but than also it is not a good solution because after   minutes of continuous wearing these my ears star paining  So I recommend you to not to buy it but if you ask me about it is quality  it is really good and bass is also good but I think these things does not matter if you can not wear it properly  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The sound quality is top class  in par with any other top branded one  However  the issue is the build quality  The plastic is sub standard and hard  But the main issue lies in its improper weight balance  It falls off the ear  I have tried all the sizes provided with the product  I tested with everyone in my family  But the issues is it is weight of the earpiece  The back of the piece must be lighter than its now  I almost returned due to this issue  However decided to keep it only because this is Indian made  and also the sound is definitely better  But it falls every now and then  I can live with that  It dropped twice while I was writing this review 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Not comfortable even with different ear tips  You will feel it with in    minutes of usage I did not face this issue so far with other brand   model Though build quality is good  it is not usable  Metal earbuds gets cold  it is an issue and you will know when you start using it I was looking for a cheaper alternatives for daily webex calls  I should have gone for Sennheiser  Skullcandy  Sony or even JBL 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Such a wonderful product it is if you know how to use it in the right way  You have to optimize the bass on the software level of your phone  Or by installing bass boosters from play store  Speaker quality is just awesome  Has deep bass with highest quality  If you have realme phones  by at your own risk  In my case  Realme did not allow me to boost bass  Maybe something would have been changed in newer phones of Realme but buy at your own risk  Works perfectly with MI phones  I have tested it on   MI devices and the output after boosting bass is pixel perfect  It also works well  but not as much as on MI in Vivo mobiles Verdict  Such a good earphone it is  If you do not get enough bass  something is wrong on your phone or on it is hardware which you might want to optimize manually 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using these earphones for a week now and use it for     hours a day I think that is these are the best earphones in this price range Here are the Pros and ConsPROS Amazing Noise cancellation These are really good for times you do not want be distributed That being said do not have out of the world expectations Remember they are wired earphones for the price of just Rs    Good Bass The bass is really good and for some songs the earphones legit shake Good Structure These earphones are really tough to tangle and it is even tougher to break them Cons They do not have the best comfort I would prefer in ear earphones BUT when the ear hooks are attached it is much better Controls  Now not everyone cares but I do There is only one button from which all the functions have to be done It would be better if there were say   buttonsAll that being said I think that these earphones are a bargain for their price and I really like them 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  CHANGE THE NAME  Why are they even named as Bass heads   I have bought   earphones from the boat and I must say Boat is something you should never opt These earphones barely fit in your ears and keep slipping out because of such a circular body they have with some weight at it ends that makes it slip out again and again Sound quality Huh  what is that  that is what these earphones say Noise cancellation is okayish  Like other earphones a common noise cancellation thing and nothing else If you are actually looking for sound just go for some another brand and Sony is one I suggest 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Mi earphones are better than this but then again nothing can compete with its durability  Listening Music is all good but can not be used for long duration as ear starts to pain  I do not want to get to details  You will find a lot of it in the reviews but what I want to point is the durability  By far the best durable earphone  Keep it in any condition and it will work just fine  Noice cancellation is not there so a bummer in public transport but that can be ignored if you turn up the volume a little high say around    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This is a nice product from boat  First of all boat provides   year warranty form any part in india  If you claim warranty in Boat website they will pick up your order by courier and replacement new unit will be sent to you within two weeks maximum  you do not have to go anywhere  This is perfect for Bass lovers  clarity of sound is nice but not at the top  It is quite heavy in the ear as it is metal finish  If you adjust the proper air burds then it will not fall from ear 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros   better in price to quality ratio  Nice built quality strongest headphone ever bought   Basses are punchy  but not overwhelming  Mids are hearable  Highs are goodTested the frequency response from an app it does have the lowest sensitivity of   hz    hz described in specification  which is better Cons   cousions provided are of cheap plastic and uncomfortable  after using borrowed earbuds from my old sony ex    felling better now  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best ear buds better than JBL and other costlier ones  Loud and clear sound quality  superb mike and reception  I was using JBL for my Star Maker Singing  Low in Volume and jad voice distortion  I bought this one recently and found it amazingly better  I was using this one an year back and after prolonged use bought JBL and Blueprint  Both disappointed me  This is perfect  Go for it  do not look beyond  and an Indian brand to boast of  Superb
Smartdevices,3,OR,  While this will not be any audiophile s favorite  the build quality can survive daily rough usage  Pretty good economic option if you want to use it during your daily workout or dealing with the chaos of road traffic without worrying if it will be damaged by sweat Recommended buy if available at around Rs      net effective price   For anything higher than that  I would suggest looking for a mid range Sony or Sennheiser alternative 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Used this earphone for   months only and one of the side of earphone went dead  Only one of the two is working now  Sound  base  and noise cancellation is good but if I have to pay     for an earphone which will only last few months then it will be better to buy a    rupees one from the roadside rather than paying    times the price for this bad quality product  And to top it off I have never even used this earphone outside  I have only used this at home for listening music  so  there was no way for this piece to go down like this 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I am using this extensive   it is a good product  audio is really good for the price but do not expect more life if you are a pro user I have been using boats earphones for last   years  This I purchased last year and it lasted me around   year   months  now   side of earphone does not work Previous one lasted for   year   months  so you get the idea about the life of this item and brand for this price range Although I would say that it is value for money but I would like to see more life out of it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  My all confusion gone   What to say about this beast  Was watching YouTube to buy best with Rs        Saw all so called  Sold Out  youtubers are referring their brand  But trust me  this is insane  Highlight is you can feel deeply all of types of music  Bass  Treble  Mid and Vocal  it is standalone Earphone  build quality is just mammoth  I got red colored on for my White colored smartphone which suits very aggressively it is Cristal clear  No other brands   Mi  JBL  Realme  Etc under       to compare  You can blindly buy 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Ruff n tuff product  I am very fond of music but those conventional plastic earphones were pathetic so i tried many earphones with rubber tip but these earphones hardly last     months  bought more than    Earphones but all waste  then one of my recommended this one to me  build quality and sound quality is amazing at this price  now I have bought Boat Wireless Airdopes     but these earphones are still with me in fit n fine condition 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Excellent earphones for the price  Sturdy and very good build quality  Wire usually does not get tangled  and is easy to remove even if it happens  Ton of earbuds included in the package  Audio quality is pretty good  Vocals are clear  mids and highs are above average and the bass is Superb     Mic quality is also pretty good and no problems there  Some people might find the earphones uncomfortable for long use as the earbuds are large Although happy with the purchase  Great product for its price 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  It did not met my expectations  I carried away with the reviews  I personally feel that real me buds   is way better than these one Build quality is top class but sound quality is average  I have used wired  necakband tws   over the ear earphonea  this did not impress me  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  There is no clarity in sound only bass is there it is the worst on high volumes Build quality is also BAD mic stopped working after   months it will not last long These earphones are very uncomfortable the buds are so hard that you will feel pain The buds get detached from the eardrums very easily and it is very annoying  Very annoying while lying on bed earpieces comes off the ear very easily   Customer service is the WORST They do not even bother to replace it Do not buy these  BOAT used to be good  but now they are selling junk 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  the boat service is amazing   i filed a complaint regarding replacement and they provided replacement after  months of buying   they are one of the best in class for bass     everyone must consider this under    rs   amazing service   build quality is not excellent but if you keep it safe  it will last longer       more piston are the only ones which are slightly better than this but they are on bit costly side plus they do not have flat tangle free wire   if you want to try for bass then bassheads     are made for you and if you want trebles then  more piston fit will be better   i mean under      these   earphones are beast  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  From my experience of     years of using this earphone here are my thoughts on this  Amazing sound quality  bass is too good and it has flat cable which holds a very good advantage ie it does not tangle like other round wired earphones  I have used this everyday for minimum    hours and it worked for a good     yearsThe thing that I did not like about it is that it is made up of metal which is excellent but if you do not wear the earphone without the in ear grip then it will keep falling rest everything is good 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The mic is good  It cancels out the background sound  The earphones are also good making the sound quality clearer and the bass is also of good quality  The only drawback is that these earphones are a little heavy and they keep coming out of my ears after using them for longer periods  But you may change the ear buds from the several ones provided and use one of your own preferable size  Overall it is good if you do not have to use it for longer duration 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The earphones are great  and live up to the expectations  have been using it since a month and I can say that  it has an amazing sound quality and durability which is hard to find under this price One con I felt is that the base is focused more than the sound quality  The base is too much that it compromises the sound quality a little bit but not much  you will not feel that much while listening 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The product is definitely worth the price and is a worthy addition to my backpacking gear  The bass is really strong and you can straightaway feel it  The only thing I disliked was in order to keep the balance  the highs have been pushed up a bit too far I am going to  It highs sounds like the old tweeters that we used to use  Bringing the highs down a touch should improve the sound  Still  I think its one hellaway thing at this price point 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros   Feels premium  Fast delivery  Metal body  ear piece   Nice color gradient black with red   Extra ear buds and holder three extra pair Corns    Sound quality not the best  Price little high  Not completely fitting on my ears I have used OnePlus bullets and it is fits perfectly on my ears   For this price they did not included a  MM TO USB C connector  Packaging not good they just put the product on cover and send it directlyOverview Recommended for budget  Not recommended for who looking for best sound quality Disclaimer  Above mentioned points are my personal opinion about the product this may or may not be suitable for you 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  it is      already and I will suggest you not to buy these headphones  it will last no more than   year There are better upgraded headphones by boat and this models is pretty old and has long term quality issues Nothing to say much about the sound quality  bass build quality etc  you can find tons of reviews online But I can surely tell that the headphones are zero water sweat resistant  If any how sweat or water enters the mic switch then say good bye to mic  it will be damage  Mine got damaged after sweat entered  After some days mic sensitivity will go down and then it will totally stop working and you have to unplug the headphones every time you recieved a call
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am a music lover and tried many headphones like sony  jbl   sennheiser but this boat bass heads over pumps the bass at sometimes which makes us uncomfortable in enjoying music  It is much more louder than other headphones  Build quality is good at this price range Bass quality and clarity is satisfactory at the price of     only I felt that Vocals and lows are not upto      clarity I recommend this headphone to only those who are bass lovers but not for the ones who loves to enjoy music and lyrics 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this earphone and after   months one of the earplug is not working so I requested for exchanging a product because it is in warranty   the concerned person came and pick my earphones and placed that for exchanging a product   after    days I get notification that your earphone was replaced and it is on the way but after one month I did not get the earphone   till now I did not get them  I mailed delivery team   called and tweet about them but no where they do not reply  Do not buy this earphone  Exchange policy is very bad and earphone is also not that good it get worse even after   month 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  do not buy this cheap earphone it is totaly waste of money  I bought this at end of January and it is mic was not working properly whenever i used it  it was stop working  I suggest you to do not waste your money to such a cheap product of cheap company I had purchased these boat headphones on    January        Suddenly it has stopped working after just   months  It has a warrenty of   year  I want this product to be replaced as soon as possible  I need headphones badly  Such a bad experience with amazon  Just want this product to be replaced man 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  According to the price charged it worth buying this earphone  The bass it awesome and the sound at its max is really unbelievableThe only drawback with this is that the extra sports  bud provided with it is somewhat uncomfortableBOAT IS WORTH BUYINGRECOMMENDED TO BUY THIS IF you R SEARCHING FOR A BUDGET EARPHONE  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Writing the review after   months  still working as first day  everything is perfect in these headphones  bass is awesome  crystal clear sound  after using these headphones I do not want to use any other headphones  I really love it  but the wire is bit too long  they said that its tangle free but because of its long wire it easily gets tangled  other than that its amazing  I dropped it a couple of times but still working just fine  i will definitely recommend these headphones  just go for it  without thinking twice 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Review after    months used Merit        Headphone sounds quality never changed till now     Quality of wire is superb and I always check this quality in headphone because it matters a lot for daily use     Mic is also better for calling    Length of wire is perfect to put phone in pant pocketDemerit I use this headphone on realme   pro and it works very well but Few days ago I use this headphone in Samsung Galaxy j  but it did not work on it   I do not know why but notice that   on the same phone I used other local headphone and all those are work  Other than this I do not find any fault in headphone  PS    must buy
Smartdevices,5,OR,  All good    Boat  Amazon   Seller  good job  Awesome perfect BLUE color  in Love  Cool Got it for      worth the money  best in the range   Good wire quality  also the flat cable   Great Bass  nice vocals   noise cancellation  etc etc etc with all music genres The only drawback is since the ear pieces are a light metal  it sometimes easily comes out of the ears due to its weight  but no worries as the clips are provided it manages things  but still can not go for long hours Finally  its BEST for the PRICE  Comfortable and Happily you can buy it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The Boat Bass head     earphone is amazing earphone   It is material quality is one of the best and also sound quality and also durability   Sound quality is one of the best better than senneheizer cx      And bass is so good  When you are listen a rock   edm like you can feel bass and vocals songs are so clear   This boat     earphone can support Google Assistant really just press   second play pause mic buttons and  open Google Assistant seriously  I purchased on lighting deal     and cashback    so price       I am so happyBoat Bass bass basssssss basssssss sa
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Pros  To be completely honest  the sound quality of these earphones really IS AWESOME  the bass is actually pretty much the best and it gives you a great sound quality  the wire also seem very strong and is tangle free mostly Cons  But if you are someone who wud appreciate some  peace of mind to come handy with ur habit of listening to music then these earphones are a big NO  only and only because of the earbuds  Since they are made of metal  these earbuds are pretty heave which means that literally every single minute one or the other earbud will keep slipping out of ur ears atleast twice and all ur time and attention will go in to fixing that CONTINOUSLY  Yes  they do provide some sort of earbud holder in the package   but good luck using them  Because if you use dem they will just end up hurting ur ears after just       minutes or they will just get lost like they did in my case In conclusion  Trust me guys  its a real problem  These earphones are so good that i would have never had anything bad to say about these earphones  if it was not giving me such a hard time with just staying in my ears 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Bought this earphones on May of        taught to let us give it a try for the boat earphones Tested and used for   months and reviewing this on October      after proper observation and testing First   most people want price to performance which I would give a rating of        The sound is clear and bass is also great at the price point of    rs   The colour I purchased is radium green which looks more crazy and stylish If we compare to other brands like JBL or sony this is slightly less in terms of performance than others brands buy anyway the earphones are       great as for me I have not faced any issues still now and am giving the review so that orther can take my opinion for there best to purchase Box   nice package you get   different ear tips and a ear type of hooks     Quality   Sound   truly clear and lound  rating     Noise cancellation  okay but not great as expected for the price      this has a passive noise cancellation which means when you plug the earphones the surrounding sound may be decreased to        even when the music is not playing Bass  is also okay for the price and please do not expect more for the rang       Rating         The seller is also  authorised  and got it on time delivery Should I recommend you yes obviously it is great for price and most importantly it is made in india Jai hind  Stay safe Thanks
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Buy with no doubts its a best budget earphone as brand name is sufficient to tell about its quality  You can purchase it without hesitation  Though i would like to highlight some cons A bit noisy means noise cancellation can be improved more  Packaging should contain an earphone case  which it has not It delivered today so I have not explored it much but if something happens between warranty i will let you know and update my feedback
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Boat is a very good brand when it comes to mid range audio tech  For the pricing you do not really have to look elsewhere  I have used Sennheiser premium and skullcandy cheap ones  I feel boat makes better products comparatively  I recommend going for over the head headphones instead of earphones  for me earphones do not last long even if I take proper care for them 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am writing this review after   years of using  and guess what they are still working   The plastic is starting to torn after   years of wear and tear  believe me  i used it very heavily These earphones got washed in washing machine twice by mistake  i thought I will have to buy new  but after  st wash they were working perfectly     however after  nd wash  their bass quality changed  i was about to book new ones but suddenly after     days the bass quality became back as new   and after that i was again using it badly    These earphones have been best of all the earphones i have used in my life  and i can buy any Boat product blindly after seeing their quality product   Pros    Best Bass Quality   Sound is loud   Noise cancellation is fine at this price   The wire doens t get tangled   The junction of wire with metallic buds is very good and protects the earphone from getting one side to stop working   L shaped jack  gives sturdy gripCons    The mic is not up to the mark  if you keep mic away from ur mouth  the voice will not go in   The L shaped jack can be problem for some people   No one ever told this problem  i have used it for   years that is why i m telling      The USP of the earphone is the weakness  the gold plated     mm jack is good for reducing audio loss  but after lots of plugging and deplugging  the Gold plating wears off  after which the jack becomes little bit loose  it sometimes detaches automatically from my phone now  but on laptop is clings tightly    note that i have used for   years   OVERALL  do not think  just Buy  one of the best Earphone out there at this price 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Buds are not the same colour of the product  which we purchase   orange   green   white headphone s buds are not the same colour which we choose  example  for orange headphone the bud are should be orange but they gave as lime green same to dark green headphone s buds  the product which we seen through the picture are not exactly same as when we buy especially for the white colour headphone in the picture the buds colour outer coated with black and inner colour is white which was nicely attracted as unique but when we buy and seen in the box tha buds colour are purely white as a normal product boat is hardworking in their headphone quality but not in the buds  what I am saying is not understandable for you just look at a glance the headphone and buds in the picture and look a glance in the unboxing in youtube or the product review picture   same as picture  buds    red   lime green   blue   black    not same as picture buds   orange   green   white   buds colour are not matching gave limegreen buds for those coloured headphones which I have mentioned as not same   I have a huge respect with boat I am purchasing from last   yrs only boat products  I have no issues in sound and built quality  it is top notch but I have someissuess in buds and packaging they should put some extrAAAA effort for making the exact colour of the buds which was in the picture and make some carefulness when packing place the exact colour as the product   Thank you  lucifer
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Amazing earphones    Nice Bass sound while listening to music or while talking on the phone using the mic       Only thing is that I found the colour of the headset a little different from the pic shown    quality is good       And worth the price     I would definitely recommend this    
Smartdevices,1,OR,  So this seems to be the latest trend on amazon I have been receiving defective products continuously since the last     times i have been ordering They do not even have the courtesy to repack it properly like in case of these earphones they were just completely tangled and laid so untidily into the box that it was immediately a dead giveaway of the fact that they are used and most probably defective since someone must have returned them in such a state and then they just repack it and sent it to me and i was absolutely correct as one side does not work at all as soon as i connected them to my phone and pc to check them for myself Never expected amazon to do this   have been a loyal customer since so many yearrs but now my order history seems to be filled with replacement orders since almost always whatever i order tends to turn out to be defective it is very clear that they try to recycle a defective product and expect atleast someone to accept the order without checking only to regret later on until it is too late   can not believe that within the last     months itself i have gotten defective pulse oximeters earphone splitters and earphones as well   literally everything i have ordered within these last few months has had to be replaced I am too disappointed  Never expected this from amazon  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Good quality cheap earphones I am writing this review after over   months of use and it works like day one  which I appreciate   Only issue with one of the ear buds that is gone loose and keeps coming out when in the backpack   Otherwise still good Likes   good build quality  decent mix of bass and treble  personal preference   I would say bass is lower than some other headphones out there but better than most in its price range Dislike   good overall finish but even after swapping out the ear buds they still seem to fall off my ears with a slight tug
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Alright so I bought these earphones at     in a deal  Let me divide it into pros and cons for you to decide if the product is right for you Pros     These earphones emphasizes on bass so  bass is good at this price range    Earphones are tangle free    They come with extra ear buds    You will not need to increase the volume since on my iPhone I have to keep the volume less than     and still it sounds decently loud    It has an L shaped headphone jack so you it will not come out easily Cons     The earpiece are quite heavy I e they tend to fall out of your ear   The inlet provided with earphones can because a bit of pain after removing it  However  you will not feel it while wearing them    The build quality could be better So  to sum it all up  These bass heads provide a very good bass at this price range and if you are someone who loves bass more than vocals then its the right choice for you  I found that the bass is overpowering the mids and highs of music and I needed to adjust the equalizer settings on my phone  I would recommend sennheiser cx    if you are looking for earphones under      but they do not have a mic so there is a downside to everything 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This is a long term review  I have used two boat bassheads     since       I like the sound quality and the bass is amazing too   Although the problems I faced was that its earbuds are made of metal  which makes them heavy  So it falls off all the time  no matter how tightly you put it in  thus  irritating  Another problem I feel is that it did not last for more than    months  Both the earphones I used lasted around       months  The wire attachment wears off from the earbud as well as from the microphone  I handle it nicely inside a case whenever I travel  even then this happened  But I would still recommend it just for the kind of sound quality you get for the price 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  It does the job just fine  Good sound quality and Packaging was all satisfactory  However in few phones like redmi its hole circumference does because an issue as we may have to place a finger on the headset s head when inserted in the hole as it might just pop out a little abruptly stopping the music  Not sure if this can be corrected but it is a good buy for the offer price 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Just amazing  plug them into ears and forget that you r living in a world  I got it for    rs in deal  so yes more than worth the money  Beautiful sound quality  with each and every minute details be it bass  treble or surrounding quality   D   Used it for games on mobile  for songs  music and speaches  Unforgettable experience Pros   Super built quality   bought it in      so more than worth the money for me   superb sound quality   different cushions for ear   wire do not get tangle everytime  it remains almost straight  do not have to solve the knots   irrespective of your device volume level  it will definitely give you a cut off from the world around you Cons   the metal portion of    mm Jack will be loosen if frequently plugged in and out of slot   The color of metal ear phone will also start fading if used in rough surfaces 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The product build quality is good  Sound quality like bass  vocals   noise cancellation is awesome  Comfortable for ears but sometimes feels bulky   heavy  The quality of the headphone shape  color combination   cover case is also good  I have purchased in the combo  If you do not have any issue with bulky   heavy headphone buds then go for it  Overall product is good       STAR from me      
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Very good earphones  Does not gets tangled easily  You get many earbuds of different size and feel  one of the best thing   Lasts long with rough use too  And you can increase it is life if you take care of it  Sound and bass quality is very good  Noise cancellation works perfectly  Instead of buying a Rs     earphone every     months  buy this  You will be able to save more as it will last for more than a year easily  It can be said it is more than a yearphone  earphone   
Smartdevices,3,OR,  This unit has awesome sound  noise cancellation  and wire quality  Only problem is that this unit does not have a call receive button  In general this button helps to receive calls and also to change music tracks  pause   play music  communicate with the Google Assistant  Amazon Alexa  while the handset lies in your pocket  However in the absence of the button  the mobile always has to be kept in your hand and all functions done from the phone itself A major fault and reason of inconvenience  Not expected at this price  Not recommended 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  These are pretty average ear phone in terms of sound quality  Bass is below average  On top of that its matt surface creates pain in ear after       mins  I am highly disappointed with this  The rubber gets separated and stuck in ear most of time  Earlier I used Mi ear phone that costed me around     but that is way better than this both in terms of sound and softness  do not waste money on this 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  This is actually a very good earphone considering the price  It is not a perfect bass type earphone  but anyone would enjoy listening music in this earphone The earphone is having a passive noise cancellation and it is goo enough for me Its good for     hrs continuous use and after that the ears start to ache Edited  Recently I found that there is no service center in kerala which made to have second thought of buying any new product from BoAt 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Be careful with mic i have replaced this because while working out the mic got damaged and it took more than   months to get them back from boat as i claimed warranty At first they are very active during the process the earphones are claimed on Warranty but after few days they lost the product and did not even inform and when I contacted customer care then they reinitiated the process so to avoid all the mess take care of ur mic it gets easily damaged with water But except mic overall performance is awesome 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Sound  The sound output of both music and call is very good and clear  I would recommend this one for gaming also where you need to identify direction sounds and all Noise Cancellation  This one got an impressive noise cancellation to enjoy music  I have tested it by playing it besides a Bluetooth speaker and I was not able to hear the sound coming from speaker Bass Quality  That totally depends on one s perspective how much bass you want  but on general it has very good bass quality and you could feel each and every beat Appearance  The color and styling of the earphone is very attractive  the color is as accurate as shown here  Plus you will get interchangeable ear buds as per your comfort Price  Price is very reasonable as per the brand  comes in your budget In comparison with other top brands this earphones is best  much better than the skull candy one 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  the sound quality is so bad for you if you r music lover  trible is so high  bass dosnt work with song  when you put volume in max then you hear bass unevely or else it works just like    rupe headphones sold outside metro station  bus stands  if you r confused between JBL AND Sennheiser  go for them  as m sure you r purchasing it just for bass  but bass qty is so bad  you will surely regret if you purchase it thinking its great  i have used sony jbl  senneiser Bose  Beats by Dre  Bang   Olufsen  Skullcandy Audio Technica   but this is really bad  if you will purchase  m sure you will start hating music  or stop listening music automatically  its magic
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Earphones keep falling off and none of the buds provided fix the problem  This is the first time it is happening with any earphone with me  Very annoying because a slightest move of the body or a tug at the wire and the earphones drop out of the ear  Unfortunately no returns and I doubt replacements will help because the sizes will all be the same  Fyi the ear wings do not solve the issue  One of the basic requirement itself is not present in this earphone due to this
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Actually I have not ever gone wrong with an  Amazon s Choice  product  I bought these boAt Bass Heads     in Ear Bass Headphones    On January   th      but got them only on   th January          Brand new awesomely built product     BASS HEADS is really apt    Sound Quality is sublime     The soft tissue earpieces makes long usage sessions a breezeActually you would not want to take them off  once you don them   Make sure you have a good media player like VLC with Equalizer set to LIVE or other setting before you fiddle around with the headset  One thing that gladdens my heart is that AMAZON S CHOICE is really Awesome  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Decent build quality but feels cold during winter  Wire would not normally get ripped off unless you try hard to break it  The sound quality is not exactly great  but with the perfect equalizer settings  you can get the sound you want  About durability  it is not that good  I had another one of the same series and it had problems with the wire  I think it was a bAsshead      So I chose      and the early symptoms of the problem still shows up sometimes  Keeping that in mind  you may purchase it  it is cheap and better than other headphones 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  So starting with   build quality  it is obviously better than your expectations  Metal earbuds you get with it  are strong enough to sustain the crowd I face in daily travel in railways   Sound quality is also good but you might feel that treble response is a bit less but at least I could compensate that with help of the sound equaliser in built in my Redmi      Well talking about durability  I have been using it since last two months and I do not think if there is any false statement mentioned in the product description given by the company  It withstood my rough use during my period of last two months    Plus you get   different pairs of earbuds for your choice of comfort and a pair of earhooks for a better grip or you can say stability  and also clip to keep your cable managed  And yes not needed to mention seperately but the cable provided is longer than enough and it is really   tangle free    Overall the review for these earphones are good and you can surely go for it if you are going for the lower range earphones 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Here are the problems that I faced with this product     Firstly left earpiece was making a lot of static noise which was very noticeable during calling and instrumental music    Then I ordered a replacement thinking maybe I got a defective product    The replaced product too had the same problems i e left side of the earphone was making static noise during call and music    I decided to keep and use the product thinking maybe these are just built like this    After   days the left earpiece kept on going on off in between the songs and hence I decided to claim the refund for the product Hence my experience with these earphones was not at all a memorable one Talking about earphones itself they are a bang for buck product  The audio quality and bass is really good  at least better than other earphones in the same price range   The build quality is really tangle free and quite sturdy Overall you can buy this product without thinking twice  you will be satisfied 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I do not why this much hype for this earphone  This is a very uncomfortable earphones I have used too many earphones  but it is in all of them except the    rs earphones IT do not FIT PROPERLY IN YOUR EARS AND OFTEN FALLS OFF FROM THE EARS AND ALSO ITS SIDE TEXTURE CUTTING HURTS THE EARS The sound is also distorted  too much bass which ruins the treble it seems like you are playing only instrumentals BUT LOOKS AND DESIGN IS VERY COOL 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Amazing product   amazing sound  Completely worth the price  However   there is a slight design flaw which does not allow the earplugs to sit in one s ear for a long time   they keep slipping out For the designer   please see if you can modify the produt body to match with https   www amazon in dp B  GQD K L ref cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_Lu pFb HQQDNZThe product in the above link does not have a slipping problem 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The Earphones are superb and quality is very good  The sound quality is very nice with good amount of bass but not very high which is a good thing   But on high volumes theese earphones loose the sound quality which isbetter in low volume   No problem till now it is has been  year   The earphones just get better and better   The sound now is still the same infact betterAfter   years The left side earphone stopped it was really good till it lasted very rough and tough used  years us no joke it kept up really well I want to buy them again but unfortunately phone has no headphone jack now 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Someone were asking for long term review  I am writing this review after   years of continuous rigorous use  Its really good  My old JBL gave up after not even an Year  The sound  the quality of the product are far more superior than my Old JBL  The body of the ear plugs are with metal  so superior  The sound is excellent and no comparison with JBL  You can hear the drop of a pin so clear and loud that you will be astonished  I have gifted   more to my friends  I am so impressed with this brand that i recently bought a wireless headset of BOAT  You can blindly trust this brand a buy these 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I bought this assuming the mic would not be important  Unfortunately had to switch with intended user and discovered the mic was awful  It only works when held at a certain direction distance by hand  Very poor design  The ear insert is not at an angle   and that makes this significantly worse and not suitable for wearning while running etc The audio is good though   brighter and more bass than other similar headphones i have used 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The sound is really good considering the prize    I am using them from last   years   and you will not believe that once my mom washed them in washing machine for    minutes   despite having no water proofing   they survived and started working just like before after   days   and still they are are working fine  although I faced some issue with the mic since starting  Rest they are good headphone   and I bought the red colour   which gives them a completely  unique  look from other white and black available  everywhere 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This headphone is not worth at this price point  One thing you should in mind that there is no service center available at most of the locations    year warranty is only a marketing gimmick only  If you claim for warranty issue you have to wait for minimum   months  I had claimed for warranty after using for    months but I got reply via email  that product pickup location we cannot reach  after   months   when warranty period is over How this brand is simply fooling us  So I do not recommend this headphone to any one Better to buy brands like JBL  Samsung  Phillips  Sony  MI  etc 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Its a nice earphone for around     rs but there are better options out there  BOAT earphones are nice but I am going to not as nice as Sony JBL Samsung Senheiser etc  These are above average in sound quality  durable and fit into your ear well  Mic also works fine and had no issues taking calls with these  I found the wire to be too long though Overall  its a decent option but do not expect JBL level sound 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have three of these boAt earphones  The sound quality is mediocre  The ear loops get loose after a few weeks and then easily fall off  The ear buds keep falling off too  boAt provides a set of these ear buds in the box  but not all of them fit  Attaching them requires you to stretch the material  which eventually loosens the groove The only thing good about this earphone is the tangle free cable  But that is not of much use when the earphones do not last long 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Lost its quality in a few weeks  At first it was good  the sound quality was balanced and clear  But later on  it gives a closed sound  I mean the sound is no longer open sound  While using mic  People seem to have trouble hearing clearly while speaking through phone  When I plug into laptop  other people cannot hear me  Good part was that it came with a box and many eat boss  I will not buy again
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Though the sound quality and performance where astounding  regretfully the happiness did not last long  after usage of    days from the day of purchase the left side ear plug ceased to function  with no options  the return window closed  left me  astonishingly  disappointed and disgruntled  with my choice  of a product from a branded company like BOAT
Smartdevices,5,CG,  There is no doubt to say that baot is my favorite brand for accessories  I like the most thing is that    Sound quality   Bass quality   Design   Long lasting productsI am using may earphones and headphones but the boat earphones has a seperate effect There is almost everything awesome in it except some weight 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Boat has compromised with earphone s material and sound quality  I have used these earphones   years back and at that time the material quality was premium and it used to feel good in hands but now it looks like you r holding some street earphones which cost around    to    rupeespreviously the earphone wires were little strong but now it looks that if a little fore is applied it will get into two parts  But any way if you love boat than go for it otherwise do not buy these earphones because i was also fan of boat but now I will not suggest these earphones
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This is my first BoAt earphone  the last I owned and lost was a JBL  I bought this earphone with a lot of apprehension but after using it for two whole days  I love it  I love the Bass and once or twice it made me look around my room thinking there were other people chatting  I was watching a video clip with restaurant scene and it was the people at the background chatting  It felt quite real  My lone problem is the Right side ear piece that keeps falling off  Could it be the weight of the metal band  I do not know  I now clip the ear phone onto my shirt  so as to not let it hang  which I think solves the problem  I tried changing the buds  or whatever it is called   it did not work  Overall  I am a fan 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Let me get straight to the point   Bass   AwesomeSound Quality   Good but it can be betterNoice Cancellation   AverageNow for the peoples with budget around     to     Rupees  it is for you guys boat offers a very good bass and good sound quality at this price range also metallic finish makes them look premium and durable For Peoples with budget around  k i would prefer go for any other earphone you have a great budget you can get sennheiser earphones at this price range with mic and if you can increase ur budget for around      then go for sony xb  ap with mic and trust me it has got the premiumness and sound both Biggest Con of Boat     earphones   it is design it will hurt you in the ears after    min usage since it have not got smooth finishing around it is earpieces and also they are very small so it will hurt you otherwise the earphones are ok   Hope this helps   Good Luck
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using the earphones for a week and can say that the sound quality is satisfactory  These are not noise cancelling earphones but do work in lowering the surrounding sounds  also the bass is satisfactory P S  I recieved the delivery later on  Sorry for the delivery feedback     also i could not change it once it was submitted  This should be improved by amazon 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Pros   Sound quality is awesome     mm drivers makes you feel sitting at dolby studio or theatre  Like the metallic design and various features of the phone  Package has extra buds  ear adjustment clip  clip to attach the wire to shirt  it is value for money  Such quality at such a price is unexpected always Cons    Feel bit heavy and pain when used for longer duration  No other disadvantages Got it for just        
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Very disappointed with the sound quality of this earphone  Honestly this earphone from Boat is the worst in this proce range  If you go for any other earphone which costs around     e g  JBL etc  that will be a better choice  There is no clarity in the audio output  forget bass  I do not think you can even evaluate on that   I expected that BOAT will be providing a decent sound in this low range earphone  I liked other earphones from BOAT speacially rockerz ones  they are far better than this  hence assumed that this one s sound quality will also be good  Now there is no option to return it also  you can only exchange it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  And a review after using it for   years When I started using it  the earphones were heavy for my ears  It used to fall off my ears  Sound quality is superb  Few months ago the left one stopped working and now the right one is also not working so I guess   years were a good life span for the earphones 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Quality is quite good   Company has majorly focused on the earpiece so you can get little disappointed with the package    But it cope up with polished metal finish and the flat wire which makes it more safer than others  It comes with   extra pairs of earbuds sizing S M   L woth colour variation of pure black ones and grey amd orange ones and also a clip to hold wire with your shirt    And that is really impressive  Talking about the sound its almost like the SONY MDRs but om half the price of them   the   mm base drive really provides a vibrational bass with ear soothing trebel balance The earpiece is also comfortable and gets stuck to the ear and the noise cancellation also works well with that   The button placed well with the mic works great with camera  calls  play pause  and changing tracks The clarity of mic is good and is placed near the mouth I rated it   bcoz it weighs little more than expected   but if you have used sony mdr then its a sure go  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I like the quality of sounds  bass and everything related to music is good  But metal design because some pain in your ears after some time  I used this headset for   months now it gives pain to inside my ears because of improper weight balance in metal head part  If you use more than   hours a day means it is not suitable for you  It is not suitable for Work from home people and gamers  It is a genuine review  If you are a continuous headset user means just consider this point before you buying it  Otherwise go for this worthy product 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am writing this review after   years of usage  never ever has any headphones lasted for   months  But these form boAt have not only lasted  there has not been any deterioration in sound and mic quality The flat cables ensure no tangling and the steel outer body has ensured this has taken all the beating and getting stamped occasionally At a frugal budget of      I can say nothing comes close to providing your money s worth 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I had purchased these as they had very good reviews and needed these mostly for call and the isolation mic feature was the one that made me purchase these  Sadly after trying them on the metal earbuds seem to be a little heavy and because a little pain in the ears if use them for long hours and since the primary purpose was for conference calls have decided to return them 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Better than many of the Earphones out there Reviewing after     years of usage  well I am not much but quite a bit rough user and the other local Earphones do not last more than   month on my hands and     years for this one was great though it died now Talking about audio  bass is good   Not sure about now after realme buds   had been launched Mic will stop working after very few months  this happened with   of my basshead      you will hear distortion if weared while riding bicycle  i know that is bad  but just to give the idea  or walking on windy days with low volume  On high volume  distortion gets hidden still happens At last  I Was really happy with     years of experience  Since the problem mentioned above made no issues to me But since those things happen  I mentioned Sound quality was great  still if you have boosted the bass from equilizer  and are listening on high volume  the mids will be muted 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  To all the prospective buyers  please note this boat headset is a treat to your ears if you are looking for good sound with a great bass  Since I am not a tech geek so cannot give you comparison with other brands and I found this is good enough for my requirement under the limited budget  under     bucks   The cable is truly tangle free  However  the one thing that I did not like about this headset is the absence of volume adjustment button or option  This is quite a basic feature yet very important for an old school person like me  I just do not want to depend on my mobile phone for volume up down thing  Because of that shortcoming I returned the item  I have shared my feedback with the company  I hope they will do something in this concern  Secondly  the play and pause button was not working on my headset  That was another shortcoming in my piece of item  Overall  this is a good headset for those who do not want to spend more than     bucks and still want good sound  good bass  sound clarity and do not mind the non availability of volume button 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The headphones are great considering its price  The earbuds are also comfortable  and with the extra earbuds it can ve adusted according to one  comfort  The sound is also good  and hearond audio stories and songs are also a relaxing experience  I have fallen in love with these  And also used them during online calsses  However  there is slightest problem regarding the noise cancellation  though  the manufacturer did not told aboutbit  as it does not come in build  Yet  it does it is job  And the wire being tangle free is great for storage So  overall I woild recommend everyone to at least try it once  And I assure you will not be disappointed considering the price 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Earphones received in damaged condition  One side not working  Box was torn and tampered  Few items missing from box  I do not know who is at fault  Probably it is a duplicate item  There is no option for return and refund  You have to take replacement from same seller  even though your experience is not good can not comment about sound quality  etc  because the earphones NOT working 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This product is right on spot for value for money  Design is much better  sound very clear and bass quality good  Got extra ear buds along with it   The cable is tangle free and mike is conveniently placed just where it should be  near mouth  These seems to be only decent earphones with straight earbud design 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It falls out of ear and is highly uncomfortable   sound quality is okay but is a bit fuzzy   it is all hyped up   i was using Samsung EHS   before which i had bought for    rs and i must say that is the best earphone at this price range and is damn comfortable even we can sleep with Samsung ehs   without feeling anything and also it provides good noise isolation unlike boat   this boat     is turned out to be one of my worst choice ever and that too cuz i bought on one of my friends say  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I will be honest with my review I purchased these earphones two weeks back  While i was looking for some genuine reviews i found some people were complaining about the earphones falling from their ears  Well for me there has been no such problem as i replaced the mid size buds with the smaller ones One problem i felt with these earphones are that they are a bit heavy  The metal finish is very good looking to your eyes but it foes because some problem if worn for a long duration  I had to take out the earphones time to time because i felt they kind of because a little strain on your ears But this is only if you use it for a long duration in one go  like     hours   The sound quality is excellent  These earphones are so loud  I did not even need to raise the volume more than         The bass is excellent  Being a bass lover i have no problems with these earphones  The wire is flat wire which is tangle free and the    mm jack is L shaped which makes it a lot convinient to use  I have only used these earphones for two weeks so i cannot say much about it is durability and all but I will update after using it for   months or so Conclusion  I am very happy with this purchase it completely fulfills my requirements  If you do not need to keep them in your ears for a long duration like     hours you can go with these  I like watching shows and listening to music using these earphones 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The product produces good bass and enough treble  along with fairly clear sound  There is not much noice and it is loud enough  I have been using JBL     SI and I found Boat stands higher in terms of loudness and bass  but lags in treble and overall sound clarity  The item looks great as well  But I decided to return after it was used for few days  as it comes out of ear quite often  owing to the heavy earpiece and cables  Moreover  earpiece is metallic and lengthy   so wearing inside bike helmet or while lying down on one side is painful 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros Sound quality  real surround soundNoise cancellationBuds get properly plugged inGood build qualityCons Does not have the remote on the mic to control volume or receive hang up calls  This is mentioned in the product description too  so if anyone purchases this should rethink if they want this kind of facility  You can ignore this if you are not going to use it during driving If I compare with Samsung  then Build quality is better as its not rubber which tears off either near the earphones or mic  sound quality is equally better in this  You can clearly fill the bass and treble 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Great Product   Great sound  noise cancellation and amazing durability I left it in my gym shorts and washed them  found it later in the washing machine all washed up in soapy water in a tangled mess If that is not a durability test then nothing is  and well the device passed with flying colours   No sound Quality or capability loss  Mic is good Tangle free cord works as advertised  wink   No residue found  all in all exactly the way I bought itI do not recommend washing it   maybe i got lucky  But i still am happy that this    rs headphones outperform my older Sineheisers in every way 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using it since three years  But each product works for only upto one year  Then it stops working on one side mostly followed by both sides after few months  But then I again buy the same product and use it as I am happy with it is efficiency  I do not get headache or ear pain while using this product unless used for very long hours  it is with   year guarantee  And different sizes of ear buds are also available  When compared with the other Earphones of even Boat and other companies  this is the best and preferred one 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  First of all  I would like to clear I use a hell lot of earphones and headphones  I purchased this product to check if it justifies its so called FEATURES or not I have been using these earphones for   MONTHS now BUILD QUALITY I will not say the BUILD QUALITY is Amazingly good  but yeah it is not bad at all  in two months i have not felt that these will get broken or something like that BASS QUALITY Now coming to that OVER ADVERTISED BASS QUALITY it is not that great at all  I am a bass lover  these provide a good amount of bass for the price point but not one of the best in the market  It can make you have a terrific headache SOUND QUALITY Now the SOUND QUALITY  it is surprisingly good and not bad at all  for the price they are the best sounding earphones available but their HIGHS   LOWS are terrible  You will not hear these clearly  but MIDS are good for the price LOOK AND COMFORT  Now coming to LOOK and COMFORT  despite of the METAL DESIGN these do not look premium at all  They look like some cheap earphones of the local market and they are not comfortable at all in the ear  The given ear buds and ear hooks lasts for a short time  the ear hooks do not help the pair to stick to the ear at all CONCLUSION  These earphones are not the best in the market but surely ONE OF THE BEST available for the price point  I hope you like the review 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good product overall    stars because of boat s terrible customer service  they would not pick it up from my home  even though their nearest centre is more than   km away from my place  Anyway  onto the product itself Boat Bassheads     in Ear Wired Earphones  have a great build and good sound quality  The earphones themselves are quite sturdy  as over the span of past   months  I have dropped them on the floor like    times by accident  Even after that  it is working without any problem  Sound quality is so so for its price  if you want to go for only good sound quality  these probably will not be your best choice as the bass is not as much as they advertise You might want to be careful with the earphone jack  as it got loose after a while for me  and the mic stopped working for a bit because of that  but it works just fine now Good for the price  I recommend 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The products break down every few months and either the sound in one ear goes off  mic stops working or some other glitch   This is the  th or  th pair I have bought in last     years I am planning to investing in a better quality earphone even though it might be more expensive   This is not a value for money 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Good purchase I purchased both this along with audio technica ATH CLR   bl Liked the sound quality in both but build quality is superior than audio technica ATH as well the price Verdict  preferable for every class go for it you can not buy a better product below     bugs   go for audio technica ATH CLR     if you can safe guard with care not recommend for rough handling     more delicate product     it is my second purchase in a year clarity in sound CLR     keep a notch High than boAt    
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Design is not very good  it is straight into the ears and is bigger than most of the earphones  it is a pain in the ear after using more than an hour Connectivity with my redmi note   pro is not very good      of the time it gets disconnected  And Google ok keeps on poping up without pressing the mic button It is not good for calling at all I do not recommend it for music as Google ok pops up on its own  I thought it is a problem with my earphone so I replaced it but the problem is still there   Maybe it is with only my device  If you have a REDMI   PRO  please do not buy this
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Earphone is good in bass quality   it will work nice with your mobile But if you try to use it with laptop or desktop the sound is not that great Also if you are using the earphones for long time  your will get some pain in the ears And if you are talking using internet audio such as through whatsapp or other  the mic does not work properly  as the other person who is hearing out have some problem in hearing 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Really worst product service  I ever got from Boat customer care services  it has been more that    days my product got picked up for repair but no updates after it and even it is customer care number is busy everytime  you can not call themAs My right side earphone has not working now  really disappointed to have this company product I would recommend not to buy any boat product because it has worst after sales service
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The manufacturer s packet was teared   appeared to be used  But the product inside was intact  seems to me that retailer put the warranty card or something inside the box  later After a week  the left side  mic side  wire of earphone begins to disturb and breaks the sound very frequently   it is getting frustrating many times do not know how to return or repair the product  earphones   Through service centre because i do not know the centres of boat The product is not  what i expected with Boat brand 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Tanglefree wiring  Bass is tremendous specially when I have Dolby stereo in my Lenovo k  note but not effective in off position of this software  Only one day old  Warranty registration is available online  Done on the website  Invoice copy is required for registration so keep it safely till registration  I downloaded one song with  D which was useless to listen on this product as compared with original earphone of my phone 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Originally order it from flipkart for   day delivery  but got defrctive product as usual  y do i even givr thm a chance   Returned  ordered from amazon  working perfectly n delivered in mint condition as usual from amazon   Sound quality is not that great i would say its a bit better than average tho  i was using sennheiser cx    before n also jbl cs    It is the least comfortable of all  but there a lot of accesaries so you can get the earbud of ur choice size n colour too never seen before  Apart from that the non tangle tag is nt      deserved i would say as without the tag attached  sennheiser headphones never tangle to my surprise  But the flat wires does reduce the amount of tangledness you would expect Bass is great if you dig that  treble is sub par Overall nice product but if you do not need mic n are willing to pay few hunders more i would suggest sennheiser for its superior sound quality comfortability n durability   its been a few days with this so i can not say much about durability  but flat wires tend to usually survive longer than normal wired headphones in my experience 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I used to be a regular customer  have bought it at least   unit till nowBought a new one  it is actually Electrocuting my ears  voice is also having strange sparking noise It is just like cheap Chinese garbage you can buy from the street which gives you a shock What a pity
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have been using Apple wired earphones and have also used Samsung s basic earphones  both of them were better in comfort and sound quality than this one When I ordered the earphone for the first time I received a faulty earphone with a microphone that had a distorting effect on my voice Ordered another one  still facing the same issue  My phone has no issues since I used my friend s boat     bass heads on my phone and it works fine  The Earbuds keep popping out of the ears  Ears start hurting even after    minutes of usage  Sound quality not great  Not comfortable  Only the design and the build quality is good 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Sound and durability are good  The wire is tangle free  The big and pretty major drawback is that the ear pieces  metallic portion  into which the in ear piece is fixed  is heavy and thus the ear phones constantly slip out of the ears  They are also heavy in the ear and given an uncomfortable feeling  While increasing the durability may have been the reason for making these heavy  metallic ear pieces  comfort is also a very important factor to keep in mind 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  In just   year I bought   bassheads     because i like them a lot  but when i bought the recent pair i noticed a dip in sound quality compared to previous models  and also is not it abnormal that in just   years i bought   pairs of the same earphones  the previous pairs lasted me about an year but this one stopped working within   months    The build quality might look good but they are very fragile from inside  And talking about the sound quality  yes they have changed the sound quality  now the bass lacks softness to it  it is very sharp  it is not what you call smooth bass  it hits you hard which is kind of unbearable when you are listening at high volumes and due to this bass the sound quality suffers  The vocals sound a little muffled and they lack treble  if you want your earphones to just have a ton of bass then go for them otherwise sensible buyers will stay away from them  now I am going to buy CX     
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought two of these headphones over a period of time The one ear stopped functioning just after the warranty period   So I had to throw it away The mic stopped functioning in the second one during the warranty period   I lodged a service request and in about     weeks they did send a replacement But the fact remains that both the purchases failed in   months to slightly over a year Highly NOT recommended 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Stop looking at those expensive companies that promise good products at affordable price but give you waste in return  Get a boAt and ride it to Nirvana  Pearl Jam and all your favorite bands and musicians  The flat wire makes sure you do not fight a tangled mess like your girlfriend does every morning with her hair and a comb  It also generously longer that most headphones  The bass is good and it has some ear holder thing to keep the earpiece in place while you jog  skip or fly   
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Nice headphone  Build quality is good  Sound and bass is great in this price point  Only this model has a issue with fit in the ear  Its always feels like slipping off from the ears  May a due to metal build of the buds and its a bit heavy weight  Provided ear hook is not enough to solve this problem  Other wise a good product  And also durable enough for rough use 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am very happy with sound quality but Boats Engg  team has made a basic mistake  while designing  Due to metal casing on head of earphones it become too heavy and keep on dropping  I think Boat has also realised the problem with product and to overcome the issue they have provided rubber hooks  But the earphones are not designed to put hooks  From design point of view I give them   rating 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Love these earphones  The bass quality is just amazing  Sound quality is so good   not disturbance  There is no noise cancellationUsing since     years  there is no problem till now in these earphones
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Writing the review after a month of usage  My first opinion is not to buy these headphone whatever bass they are going to offer is usesless as the headphones do not fit in your ear properly Why  because of the heavy weight of the buds as you can see these buds are made of metal the are on the heavier side this does not properly fit in our ears What is the use of extra bass when it does not fit in your ears Moreover using these headphone for    minutes gives you ear pain  Know why  because of the heavy weight  This earphones are useless untill they reduce theweight of the pistons 
Smartdevices,5,OR,    Lighting fast delivery from Amazon   Immersive sound  Bass is good  Noise cancellation makes you feel the sound properly   You need to choose the proper silicon earbud for better noise cancellation   The mic  multi function button gives a premium feel to handle   Over all worth the money with same day delivery    hrs timeline  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I purchased this earphone after researching many other earphones  I am amazed  this earphone gives beautiful bass driven clear sound and music  Fits the price tag with the quality of sound it gives  I purchased from   Appario Retail Private Ltd   Go for it if you want  cheap and best  earphones with a good Bass system 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A EARPHONE WITH GREAT BASS AND HIGH VOLUME AND YOUR BUDGET IS UPTO      I CAN EASILY SAY THIS IS THE BEST EARPHONE IN THE MARKET PROS    BASS         SOUND QUALITY        QUALITY         COMFORT     CONS    SO TIME YOU FELL BASS IS TOO MUCHIF YOU do not HAVE A BUDGET ISSUE GO FOR THE SENNISHER CX     IT HAVE BETTER SOUND QUALITYBUT IF YOUR BUDGET IS UPTO      THIS IS THE BEST YOU CAN GET
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Used several Boat products in the past and this was also bought with that same confidence  However  this one disappointed me very badly My experience with this order Pros  Fast and perfect packaging in delivery of this earphone  Built of the speakers is good and specifically  the cross marks make it easy to hold and handle  The flat wires look firm and strong  The mic is responsive and catches the voice OK though not amazing Cons  The biggest problem with this product is that the earphones do not fit in the ear  Initially  I felt it could be me  and so we tested on my teenaged son and daughter and also my wife tested it  Everyone faced the same problem  If we try to push it hard to get firmly stuck in the ear  we lose getting the volume  Because of these cons  the bass and other quality aspects are very difficult to even notice  This feature is making this earphone the most unwanted one at home 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  These headphone are sturdy  and build quality is superior Sound is quite amazing for the price  I grabbed these for     rupees  I got   pairs of black and   pairs of red plugs  small  medium  large sized  The one in all button is easy to use I am very happy with the tangle free wire design The biggest down side is that the ears plugs are heavy and keep falling off    even when I am not moving walking  You have to use ear plugs support  you get   pair of these in the package  to avoid this problem     boAt team  you need to do something about the weighty earphones    there is no other problem with the product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Really Good Earphones in that price rangeSOUND        STEREO      BASS      NOISE CANCELLATION      OVERALL        Bass lovers would love itMultiple earbuds availableMy Recommendation   Go For itPurchased Baseus H   earphones in the same price range before this   it stopped working after couple of months
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I ordered two nos sets  Really liked the ear phones  Bass is quite good with adequate midrange  Noise cancellation is also very good Quality of material is standard with tangle free flat cables    Earlier I used Falatek brand   this set is similar to that  Simply Value for money Initial impression  value for money with good sound quality  Amazon service is also as expected  Just grab one  you will not regret Strongly Recommended 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using BOat for past   years  I have bought   headset  though the ones i broke are defintely because of my abuse But the one i bought   months ago  had a very bad mic issue about   months ago  I claimed warranty by visiting the website Waited   weeks no replay  I again redid the entire process  a person picked up my product after   days and got a new mic after   weeks Overall I am satisfied with the new headphones If you wear it for longer hours ears do tend to hurt  Five stars for keeping up the warranty promise and not cheating customers 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it is a very good product I got it at     see for price up and down befor buy if you have Tight budget Packaging is good  Inner main products packaging could be more durable Sound quality      Bass is really extraa as it mentioned Vocals also good    Design    Colour  Total   colour all are very good    Specially black colour which is not actually pure black it is shining military greenish  shaded Earbuds are soft    More than enough extra pair of budsMic is good     Cable length      MTRFlat cable  really good tangle free wire    Over all very good under    rs Thanks
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The ear drums are very heavy as it is metal on top of that the wire is long which adds to the weight further more  This results in uncomfortable listening and the earphones comes out quickly   can not walk or run with this  The sound quality is good  Almost no difference between this and the other cheaper boat earphones  Bass is fine 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have been using this product for last   days may be  initially it was so good now sometimes I feel the sound is little noisy and I do not find clarity even when I listen meditation music  But that is not issue so much and its not noise cancellation earphone wrong advertisement by Cloudtail or apperio I think I will make return of this product because after using the earphone for   hours continuously I found my ear is paining not for the sound but the speakers buds are heavy weight wise   I guess I needed lighter earbuds so that my ears do not pain even I use it for more time 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have seen products costing far less than these  with no warranty offered running for years at length  I have donated or gave them to someone in working condition  But these earphones had such a shoddy quality in terms of being reliable that one earpiece stopped working only after a month s use  For the price you pay  one expects a product that lasts long enough to at least see through it is warranty that the manufacturer offers  And I chose them over JBL   Sennheiser because the customer reviews were talking good about this product besides being very economical in comparison  Lesson learnt   moving on  I have sent email to them for warranty support team  let see what happens P S  do not buy this product  perhaps it is better to invest more in a product that is serious about upholding its brand value than sell sub standard products in the market 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This product is sturdy  I have been using it for a few months now  the sound quality is good   very good noise cancellation  I would not know if there was an apocalypse outside BUT  my issue lies with the bass  While I knew while purchasing this that this was a bass specific headphone  I had NO idea the bass would be SO overpowering  Like omg  the moment I turn the volume up beyond the medium range all I hear is the bass    Even in the type of music that I had no idea had bass at the far background  even that bass is enhanced  drowning out everything else  Not every song needs that much bass you know  Took me some time to getting used to   it is a good one under budget but seriously if you are not a bass fan then I would recommend not to go for it Also  I am not a tech geek or gadget freak  I am just an average user    I still have not figured out how to use those silicon hook thingys Oh   another thing  the earpiece     Sorry if I am using the incorrect term  do not fit in very snugly like they are supposed to  They just stay stuck at an odd angle  Very uncomfortable to watch   listen to stuff while lying down Mic is good 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This in ear headphone with microphone from boat produces high quality sound with balanced high bass sound  though it could be slightly improved  Treble is decent and if the original recording is good  the reproduction is excellent That said  the rubberized flat wire looks fine but needs to be handled with care  It can break if it hooks on to some object during mishandling  It has thus far survived some minor skirmishes with objects 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Stopped working twice Got it fixed the first time  when it stopped working within   months   great customer care team  Took care of pickup  fix and drop for free as it was within warranty period Second time was after    months of use  the portion above the mic just fell off at some point  and I did not even notice till the next day when I took it out of the bag Great audio quality  but poor durability 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The product build quality is good  that is the best thing about it  Also this one comes with   year warranty  But i was quite dissappointed with the purchase because Ifeel its not the best product to listen to music movies  I have focal headphones I bought this year and compared to it this is not upto the mark  May be for the price this might be worth it  I would recommend the price of     for this  Not more than that 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Nice and quality earphones but I am facing issues with the fit  I have tried like every pair of buds I recieved but since they are of metal  they are really heavy and hence I have to hold them with my fingers while I listen to music or stay very still which is not good  Otherwise the sound is great and quality too  Moreover comes with a boat experience  I have been using them for quite a time now and till now I have not faced any issue with build quality  Although the company should make the microphone quality a little better Hope this review is helpful in your buying decision 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I am not a person who reviews a lot  I took some time to compare it with different earphones  This is my honest review  I am using  More Piston and Samsung Level you  I bought this after seeing many positive reviews and my piston is almost damaged  I am comparing this with piston as it comes in the same price range Build quality    Noise cancellation      Volume    Bass         yes  this is mistaken as good bass due to the high volume  Comfort       This is one of the worst earphone I ever used  When you put this in your ear  it is like an air pump pushing inside  I tried changing all ear buds  But none helped  Comparing with my  More piston  Piston is feather  First time I wore this earphone  what came to my mind was  is this thing original or did the seller gave me a replica  My overall rating is    Buy this  if you travel a lot by bus or train  This have good noise cancellation and good volume  The sound quality is very distorted 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  All good but initially had a glitch which I rectified myself  When I connected the headset to laptop  there was a noise at the recipient end  When checking the mic  found a wire terminals touching each other  After correcting them  works fine now  Average bass and quality  Ear starts to pain after sometime of using   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Design is outdated as compared to Ant W    performance is great because of larger drivers as compared to others  Bass is better than W    If you play games like PUBG then these are the earphones to go with as the its sound delivery in isolating footsteps from other in game sounds is unparalleled  Your gameplay will improve because you will begin spotting enemies easily due to the footsteps advantage  Performance is great and surprisingly good for     rupees 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Well guys i went by reading the reviews   brought it for my parents as they just used it for watching serails or talking on calls  however no doubt in sound quality but after sales service is pathetic in this lockdown the earphone stopped working so have shared an email to boat but there is no revert from them so ideally guys they are making fool as not giving after sales service Please do not purchase 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Sound quality is amazing  Loudness is unbelievable  Distortion after     volume as for Redmi Note   Pro   May differ from phone to phone  build quality is amazing very strong  Comfort is the best  Only thing is that the gold plated audio jack is no more of gold after one and a half months usage      But I would recommend it to buy it becomes of excellent sound  No problem with Trebble  But if your looking for best of the best  then look for dual driver earphones to get superb bass and Trebble   all at once       Search  A I of  Tutes  on YouTube for most detailed review with Unboxing 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Boat products are always up to the expectations and Bassheads     are no different  I have already purchased the same product   years back and it is still working perfectly fine  Handles rough use well  even after getting drenched in water  It does not have any IPX rating  but handles shock  dirt and water splashes well without getting damaged  Product is a great deal for the price and the best Bassheads in its series 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  i have owned many earphones since past few years but i strongly recommend these ones if your arround a budget of         inr  simply awesome  these are nice in build quality   offer very good sound and are adjustable as come with alot of ear tips within the package  there are many negative reviews about these but i did not feel any complaints or issues so far i have been using these for about some days  will update if any issues occur these are best at this price point as they also come with inbuilt mic and button just do not think much and go for them
Smartdevices,3,OR,  the sound output is very good    the attached rubber buds of the received earplugs kept coming off in the ear itself  it was horrifying removing that rubber bud stuck in the ear     and none of the other buds received with the earplugs were a comfortable fit  the quality of the buds and their fit to the earplugs should be very comfortable  precise and accurate    Had to find and replace rubber buds with older ones from other ear plugs    Solve this issue and you are a great competitor for skull candy as your rates are cheaper and sound quality at par    wish you luck for the same
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Actually everybody prefers to listen positive review when they are purchasing a new think    but please consider my point of view    I am writing this review after   year this product look nice but    every time sinening think is not a diamond   I purchase and what I got in my hand a defective piece then I returned it and called for new one I thought I got good and I am happy after some days and weeks are gone I came to know the truth   the truth is that this product and companies service is worse   then I have ever seen    the voice is getting fade and mic is not working and the jack is totally damage    it is not at all considerable to use in daily life    the customer will not provide you any service and will eat your precious money      so friends my suggestion do not waste your time and money on this product and this company try for jbl and Sony those are good and better then this cheap product  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  People with small ear lobes should not buy this earphone The earphone is a bit bigger than other in ear phones and causes pain in the ears and you feel your ears are stuffed   It puts a lot of pressure on the ear drums which I feel is not healthy I cannot even return this now  stuck with thr ear phones 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Pros    Good  clear and loud sound   Awesome BASS   Strong build quality of wire and earbuds   Good quality clear mic   BASS BASS BASS BASSCons Bass Beats product but not for Crystal clear sound   If you want clear crisp sound then buy Senhizzer or if you watch movies in phone with songs or play games then go with this BOOM BASS Wrote review after usage of   months
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worst Earphones and WORST AMAZON SERVICE EVER  I have been an Amazon customer since a long time but now Amazon is not providing refund for this worst Earphones ever used in last     years  The sound quality is nice but the mic and metal earphone are so heavy that they keep falling out of your ear  I have used all rubber buds provided in the box and even tried my Sennheiser buds but still a little movement and they fall  I do not want this earphones please Amazon do not replace it just give me refund for this poor product 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Please do not buy these earphones_i am writing here after   months of use _i did not say the problem is with sound quality or built quality anything__but here the case is one can not able to plug these earphones in and this is very annoying and total waste of money i think no pblm when connected with support they give with it but with support they hurt very much you can not able to use more than   hr with support because ear start pain please take my review seriously this is very big pblm if you buy these you realise after sometime Thank you
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It is the first time I am using BOAT headphones  I am also using a Philips headset of the same price range  The sound quality of BOAT headphones is just awesome  I now prefer this headphone for watching movies   It fits in the ear perfectly  The packing was also good The only dislike is that the fluorescent green color has faded after   months of use  So I am giving only   stars  But that can be ignored when you get good quality sound for this price 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The products of BOAT are  no doubt  sound and performance wise very good which is their selling point   But the earphones stop functioning on one side within a month So   after a month you will be wondering what went wrong  Then again you buy a new bOat earphone because of it is performance  then the same story repeats within a month   I ended up purchasing     bOat earphones   Next   their warranty claim is of no use   It has been made very hard that you cannot register your product and even registration is success   you will not get a mail  I was extremely saddened because my expectations with this start up were something different This is my last purchase  Request to company   Try to attract customers by consistent good products not by cheap parlor tricks
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought   on different times or     months gap except one which I lost with in    days rest   max worked for     month on an average My recomendation do not buy I will post my next review on the service qualitu once i find the service center  and if they can fix the issue 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  With the tangle free cable of appropriate length and an one button mic operation the boat bassheads     is a complete package  Based on my   month usage I am penning down my scorecard for this headphone   Jack quality and connectibility        cable quality         button call pickup and pausing songs         music clarity       treble        Bass        noise cancellation at     vol        comfort        or may be      with the correct earbud  many sizes provided in package   durability         no tears  cuts or breakages in this   months     Looks     Overall I would rate it      Hats off to Amazon for its excellent service and hassle free delivery Got this product from Amazon in      on sale Thank you Jai Hind 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Decent sound quality  Do not compare to a JBL or Sony as they are much more loaded and expensive  Great product for the price range it comes in  compatible with my HP laptop for work calls as well  The zipper pouch is very good quality and comes with an insert pocket for the extra buds as well 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I gifted it to one of my friends  Sound quality is moderate  This product has a mic which is a plus  She is using it for about   year  It is still working fine  This product has a   year warranty  I do not need a mic  thus  I use Sennheiser CX    which I got at an offer price of      The sound quality of Sennheiser is better and they offer   years warranty  Headphones often get damaged after   year  so  I prefer products with   years warranty  However  if you need a good budget headphone with mic  you can always buy this one 
Smartdevices,1,CG,    months worked fine     after that the button which is available is pressed automatically i e  ok Google is generating automatically with that  and also volume is getting increase and decrease automatically when plugged in    worst evere service from this     I have not yet completed the one year warranty for this product 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  the product is very nice sound quality is awesome  only the problem is the weight of the earphone due to the matel body  its heavy as it randomly fall from your ear while walking or running  you need the extra rubber material  name do not know  which gives with the box you have to attach it while walking or running  for indoor or if you love to listen music on bed or couch then its do not give you any problem i used this earphone last   months   its work totally fine clear verdit   if you want a earphone for indoor then definitely go for it  but if you love to listen music outside while walking or doning any work then its gives you some problem  if you ok with that then go for it
Smartdevices,5,OR,  These are my second pair  the first one last for around    years  I should say that boat products are very well made and long lasting  the pricing is perfect  the sound is decent good amount of bass  the only con i could find is that the ear buds are quite heavy and tend to fall out of ears and it is made up of metal but to help with this issue company gives us wingtips and a clip which you can use to keep the earbuds in place 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I recently purchased boAT     in ear headphone with mike  The headphone is very well build  The material feels premium and long lasting  The headphone used flat cables  thereby making them tangle free  It is easy to manage and keep  The length of the wire is enough to keep the mobile phone in your pocket or backpack Another highlight is the inclusion of   pairs of silicon ear cushions and two anti skip ear hooks  The err cushions come in   different colors  The headphone is easy to wear and will not give pain on long use  The buttons and headphone looks premium The performance is also impressive  High and mid frequencies are produced very effectively  The lyrics are very clear  The only issue is the low frequency  Bass  I found bass very low  One has to use equalizer to increase bass level  If your mobile or music device does not have equalizer or tone control  then lower frequencies are flat Overall  it is very well build  trendy and good in ear headphone 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  i bought   earphones and jbl s       and boats       and       this one being the midrange among these three   was the worst one  boats       was much much better and comfortable than this  This is also too big and uncomfortable for the ears  It keeps coming off  Though it might look good in pics but I will say go for other   as per ur budget and avoid buying this one It does not hav return option also   only replacement is available   as i would hav bought another jbl instead of this
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Good bass and noise cancellation  Superb quality but only flaw is it does not hold well in the ears and slips frequently  Tried various sized cap and just OK  Life needs to be seen  Did not use for long time  Anyways value for money 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am excited about this ultra bass earphone at this price range  Bass is very deep and clear  Sound quality also very good at this price  Durability is awesome  I am using it above   yr but the earphone looks and sound quality is like still a new product Tangle free wires are superb But the only cons  is the comfort for wearing  Comfort is very worse due to lengthy earbud  It slips from ear when hearing otherwise it is awesome 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This is absolutely fake product  Initially I felt it to be genuine but when I noticed the speaker part the notification of left and rignt was not mentioned at the metallic end but at the rubber end  Moreover position of mic is also not accurate as shown in images  I suggest you guys to prefer buying boat earphones in showrooms instead of online since there is a greater probability of being cheated   Hope my review was useful to you   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using this  earphone for   months I would say it is bang for buck  I would take back all my word  which I mentioned during  st week of purchase and they are some problem surfaced during this past   months like have to plug multiple times to connect and mic the other person is not able to listen to my wordsReview during  st week of purchase Its just a earphone with very good bass  Bad lows  I seriously feel the ubon is much better and easier to buy in local shops with lesser cost 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  These earphones are almost perfect  They sound good  they look amazing  tangle free as promised  durable and affordable  The only con is the Discomfort  The earpieces are made out of metal  so they are a bit heavy at the end  If you do not use the clips they provide in the box  the earphones will keep falling   Even after using them with clips  the main issue is comfort  Use them for more than    minutes  and its hell for your ears  So UNCOMFORTABLE    I bought the orange colour  looks great 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I dunno if its the design or the kind of sound that they produce but they are not comfortable at all  high mids and lows are not distinct At first they give an impression as if they are pretty good but listening to then for some time you realise they ate a pain in the ear Not suggested The design is faulty  straight canal and pretty short too which puts pressure on your ear cartugaes and hence makes them ache
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this product a month ago  It was good at the start when I first started using it  After  nd week I noticed some music cut off I thought it might have been device issue or the music file  But it became frequent  Now now the left earpiece stops working frequently  Sound quality is good but the main problem is its life cycle  I will quote it with   Chale toh shamm tak nahi toh chaand tak   It means it might work till evening or till the world s end 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent earphones  I purchased it just because it had been reviewed by       people   God know how many people might have purchased this Decent sound quality and bass as per the price is concerned  Sound quality does not drop even at full volume  Look and feel are beautiful and durable respectively  Go for it if your budget is limited and you have too many options 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  When i listen song in boat     bassheads earphone i am glad to listen the song because in boat earphone many advantages and disadvantages    good bass quality    trendy look    clearity super bass     year replacement and custmoer suppourtDisadvantages are      if you listen song approximate half hour then earpain and headache    made in china product    not perfect fit for ears
Smartdevices,2,OR,  As the name suggests   Super Extra Bass   That is all it has  Except for the Bass  the sound quality is very poor  It is like sub par earphones with an increased Bass setting I also needed to use the mic to attend calls  The mic seems to have no noise cancellation at all  Everyone who is on the call with me complained of high noise and low volume Overall  not worth the money  JBL or Sony earphones are much better  I just fell into the  on sale  trap and bought it for     INR 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The sound quality is ok at this price point  The sound has too much treble   very little bass even after adjusting bass on Spotify  Played Dangerous  ft Sam Martin  by David Guetta   it is a Sin by Pet Shop Boys to check the sound quality  Neither of the songs had much bass to enjoy the song 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  So to be honest I was little uneasy about this headphones but it is pretty goodCable length is greatSound quality is also greatBass is not as expected but you can tweak your phone to enhance the bass like I have done in my phone so overall the product is good go for me 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The headphone worked fine for   months  The bass quality was below average Then one of the ear piece stopped working I raised a ticket in the BoAt portal for warranty and I can see the status as Approved  Its been already more than   months  no response from anyone even after multiple email follow ups 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Detailed Review Now I had high expectations with the earphones but for some reason it just did not match as actually the another earphone which is Boat     was a great choice then this at the same price point    Sound   The way plugs are designed  the sound comes a bit hollow and not pleasing  even at high volumes there is a lot of distort  but boat     was great then this    Mic   Apparently there is not any noise cancellation  and people on another line are not able to hear properly at times    Design   Its great  No issues with this Tbh  go for the Boat     earphones  they are better then this  This is just a   star product 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Good earphones  had been using them for   years  Good sound quality and noise cancellation but the main problem might be with it being a flat wired earphones  I used them normally  not putting them carefully back after using  maybe the wires got bent  Sometime down the line while using them I accidentally put them in reverse order and noticed that the sound in left ear was lower than the right year  did not notice in regular usage as it was diminished slowly and my ears got trained to the lower sound in one ear  Definately not good for the hearing  I quickly switched to wireless earphones after that 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Absolutely terrible design of ear pieces  I am not going to put a  cm capsule in my ears just for listening to music or Youtube The quality of sound is great no complaint there  the tangle free cable  ear hook  build quality everything is just about perfect but the most crucial part is unusable The ear pieces are really heavy  what can we expect from metal furnishes  It falls off with the slightest movement  the ear hooks kind of works  but I do not expect running or walking with such a heavy earphone I had to replace it for an even cheaper one and they sound just the same with comfortable fit and I do not have to sit at a spot with neck stiff and ears having excruciating pain So overall The sound quality is just perfect  It depends on sound drivers and cards  The bass works  as they advertise they do have extra bass for bass lovers The build quality is impressive  tangle free cables  mic  L shaped connector with good connection and everything But finally it is not worth it if you want to listen to music or Youtube for long sessions  it is painful and heavy
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The earphones are too heavy  I did see few people pointing it out in the review and that turned out to be right  they are too heavy to stay inside your ear  Tried different buds and also tried the clip and still the earphones just drop out of your ears  I understand it is not during workout but they will not even stay in your ears even when you sitdown  We constantly have to adjust them which is annoying and cannot enjoy the music  Sound quality is fine  Returned the item 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Talking about sound quality  there is something off here  The  highs  are uncontrolled and unpleasant The  mids  are muddled   Lows  are a bit better In short Heavy rock songs are going to hurt your ears Treble     Mid     Bass      Better options  Yes  but         Rs more    sennheiser cx     no mic    Sony MDR      rs 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I found the product very reliable  and survived close to an year even when used few hours a day  The product is good but the support is not responsive  My earphones developed a defect within the warranty period but did not get response from the given mail id  Overall  it was a good experience owning the first pair   hence bought a  nd pair to replace the first one after it became defective 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Pros  Price Loudness  Sub woofer kind of bass  Good for bass boosted  music   Built Quality  Super Endurable flat wires  Cons  Dead Treble Microphone not upto the mark  Bad for  vocal music  Vocals get submerged under bass  You will not hear any They can make these pair of earphones to the top just by providing a Balanced Bass and Treble       not         Because loudness is there  Just the treble is getting submerged that is it  Thank you 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The best in the range    Sound quality is good  The built quality is nice and firm  The wires made of good quality material  Right side of my earphone stopped working after   weeks of use but I am not going to make it negative because the replacement service provided by the manufacturer was really good  I just dropped an email to them and they arranged everything from pick up to delivery on their own and my earphone got replaced in   working days  I do not know about other Brand s after sales service but here with boAt you are getting an superb after sales service if your product stopped working  On the other hand earphones are really good and you get so many accessories with it  So  as per my personal opinion you should go for this one  Best in it is category   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Sound quality is excellent based on the price tag and overall performance is goodthere are some pros and cons of this product  my pros and cons are based by also considering the price tag it has Pros     Very good sound quality and drivers  Bass and high are nice    Flat cable makes is less tangle  not tangle free    the bend at the audio jack side comes in handy    Long cable  perfect for gamers like me who play   to   hours continuous   It does not hurt my ears in a long sitting   The mic is really good Cons     The earphone is little heavier than normal  sometimes tries to slip  but manageable   The earphone is metallic finish and sometimes it gets too hot or too cold based on weather but it gets normal after a few minutes of usage
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I liked the product when it come  Hood quality earphones which stopped working after   months  Good sound quality as i am not able to listen it  Noise cancellation is super because it never worked  In one word i will be perfect to refuse for many reasons  If you want to waste your money   Go for it  You will surely waste your money  Ok now come on conclusion these are good in bass  The bass quality is awesome  But the vocal and beats could be better  I have used them for   months  They worked perfectly  But after   months one side become dead  As they are in under warranty so i consult the boat officials  It has been   days the have not contacted to me  But when they contact i will surely update 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Bass pretty goodMic is greatIt has long wire  feel good I Continually used for for   months then its internally damaged  stopped working After that  again i purchased new one  i used it  and it was also stopped working after   monthsCONCL   Not suitable for long time use  but product is Nice for this price range 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The Jack of the headphone stop working after   months  But when I contact the customer service they told me that my address is not suitable for pick up the headphone  After   months is use another address and this time they pick up my product  After    day they give me a brand new headphone with   pair of ear buds  because I requested them to give me a ear buds as I lost them   Overall experience is good but one thing is not good  In their warranty claim they told that they could not extend the warranty claim so I have left only   month warranty of this new product  At last on this product I want to tell that the sound quality  bass quality and noise cancellation is excellent with in     ruppe  You can buy it without any doubt 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I purchased these earphones a while ago  but suddenly due to its flat cable structure the internal wires were getting damage and multiple folds  As a result firstly my right earpiece stopped working and after few weeks due to multiple tangles the left one also stopped working I will suggest not to purchase earphones having flat cable structure  but always go for a kevlar enforced or a round braided cable Also do not go for Boat company as they use the flat structured cable in almost every product they sell Worst earphones I must say       
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is a The Best Headphone For Bass Lovers  sure you can not find a Best earphone below      comparing with BoAt       Best part is boat warrenty   they will sure Replace the item if it not works between   year warrenty   that is Promising   I already bought in Jan       After that Now i first ordered BoAt     Red in Flipkart its really worst   So i returned and Again bought BoAt     From amazon Same seller now also   Best Best Best nothing can i tell   Its the best earphone   do not think about second thoughts on Realme buds or Boult or JBL or Sony or Senheissor or Skull candy  Below      rupees  BoAt     is the BOSS than all other companies      degree tilted earphones makes Headpain and ear problems  This is      Best in all case due to normal buds   I Highly Highly Recommend this to all people who Lobe Music   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I had a doubt whether I should buy or not since I was using Skullcandy and sony headphones previously but both of them had one character in common  One of the speaker stops working after using for a fair amount of time  I am writing this review after using boats for quite a long time now and trust me it is awesome  The build  the design and the sound   simply wonderful  Buyers do not hesitate and go for it 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Finally they send duplicate one  sound quality is very poor  No bass boost and quality of the wire is very thin and easly get damaged i am not satisfied I ordered boat     earphone but I get duplicate product without accessory then iam returned that earphone now March   I get another replacement earphone but this time iam getting different model     without accessory again
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good product  good sound  really good built quality  strong and sturdy for rough use The thing bad is that you can not wear it for a long time as it pains in the ear as it is metal and a bit heavy In comfort I would suggest JBL it is so light weight that you will forget you are wearing earphone 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am writing this review after about   months of usage Excellent quality for the price  My usage is quite rough and these earphones seem to endure it fine so far there is a slight discoloration of the coating but like I said earlier  it is due to my heavy usage Important Update This Boat Earphone works with Skype without any issues  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best sound quality and bass with good noise cancellation  But music is felt too loud to handle some time due to the rich base  But if you are looking for rich bass  durable and low cost headphone  this is the one for you Cons    Rich bass   Highly durable  best for rough usage   Great noise cancellation   Loud sound   Low cost than other headphones   Highly durableCons    Music can be too loud sometimes   Treble is overpowered by the bass   can not stand sweat  If you are sweaty like me  sweat can enter the button using the flat wire  It may because you software glitches sometimes  which is a headache  But starts working after drying 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The product is just perfect for the price range  I have used sony and jbl before  but they lack some or the other features like sound quality  noise cancellation and even the built quality  But this one just ticks all the boxes  You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under  k Quality         Very high quality materials are used in it  Headphone jack is gold plated and the connector is very sturdy  Plastic quality is also great  Sound chamber is made out of metal  Wires do not get tangled  unlike some of it is competitors it also uses flat cables but unlike them it does not get tangled at all Durability        After using it   months continuously and meticulously  all I can see they are like tanks and are very sturdy in nature  Even after having few accidents with them they are more or less in pristine condition Audio  In this category it will score out of the boundary six  Noise cancelling and audio output of the headphones are boon for every audiophile Comparison  Between it and a Xiaomi Headphone  the difference is night and day  it is hands down a miles ahead of the Xiaomi Pros Better Sound quality than it is competitorsBuilt quality is great  metal finish Better Noise cancellation than it is rivalsBass is just awesome  I am a fan of it Better pricing of all Cons Nothing as of now
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Headphone design is great  Sound quality is good  Mic also tends to be working wellI chose the blue ones and they are quite fashionable  People notice when I have these headphones on If you have small ears  though  and have difficulty keeping them in  I would not these ones as the body is kind of heavy and the earphones often fall off I like them  but I wish the body was a little lighter Product quality is great in the price range
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Sound Quality is good considering the price of this item  But the mic went dumb very soon not even a year was completed and the mic needs to be pulled very close to mouth for proper communication it will not work in a distance of   inches  The inside wires seems to get messed soon too  sometimes one earpiece stop working properly and a distressed signal comes from that 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Boat I love you guys  These guys have amazing customer service they really care about us  consumers  I brought these earphones on August       I have been using it  Previously I used to have sennheiser cx    and CX     after using these two earphones sound quality standards are damn high for me  But unfortunately  I am not good at taking care of things and I ended up losing them   cx       CX      while travelling  So for I started using these boat     so that I do not regret losing as they cost only    rs These babies are good too good for the price  And the warranty for   year is freaking awesome In March      my boat earphones stopped working  All I did was to register the device and raise a complaint for my warrant  They arranged pickup for my earphones  And within   days I got my earphones replaced with this awesome pouch Ratings Sound quality     Bass quality   Material   Customer service   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This is one of the best approach to which I had purchased from Amazon  One of the best bass earphones after Apple  the build quality is also good it has the metal like finish  tangle free wire this is one of the best approach to which I had purchased from Amazon  One of the best bass earphones after Apple  the build quality is also good it has the metal like finish  tangle free wire  The quality of the product has also go The quality of the product is also good   The pricing is dam awesome 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  So Black one was bought in Dec       and  side stopped working in Dec        so ordered Red one this time   but wire quality looks cheaper this time by touch   and in photos we can see diff  as black is smooth   and red has marks as it was folded in box packaging   but black never had these marks during delivery time  So I am not sure if someone at store used it and did not keep it back properly before Amazon packaging  ALSO PLS NOTE WHILE OPENING BY SOMEONE BOX GOT TORN  SEE PIC  AND THIS TORN PART WHERE BASSHEAD SI WRITTEN WAS ATTCHED INSIDE WID TAPE TO FOOL CUSTOMER   WHY THEY can not GIVE NEW PACKET  UNUSED EARPHONES
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I and my friends have bought   of these earphones at different time intervals and none of them has survived the   month mark I think there is some static  prominent problem with these as we all faced the same issue  one sode stops working and we have to get it replaced  under  yr warranty  from the service centre  only if your city has one  PLEASE DO NOT rely on their pickup service for replacement becoz they pick up the product on time but do send a replacement unit  it is been   months and I have not received mine  The customer care number does not connect and they do not reply to the emails  So  consider it gone if you have sent it already Try other brands like jbl or sony 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is the best you can get in this range  it is very reasonable for the qualities it has and the accesories provided along with it  The body of the Earphones is itself very strong and durable  And the level of bass  sound quality and noise cancelling is incomparable  it is really good  I bought this one before in       It stopped working recently  Comes with a warranty around a year but mine lasted for more than   and half year  Go for it 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  I wanted a headphone having good Bass at affordable price so  I purchased this one after seeing so many positive reviews but all in vain  Its sound quality is normal Sound quality disappointed me  It does not have good bass Super Extra Bass written on box is just for an advertisement  if you are a bass lover like me  this product is just disappointed 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  If you looking for earphones with a price range of          voila  you got why you r looking for  I am not saying this is the best one  but for this price  I can definitely do  The extra pairs of ear buds that come along with this irritating because they do not fit into ear phones head that easily  but they look really cool all with the color gradient and the shape   The quality of wire is good and the claim that it is tangle free is also true  The metallic design makes it even more interesting Final verdict  go for it
Smartdevices,1,CG,  One side was not working so i filed for replacement  they came and collected the damaged product after that its more than   month there is no response from their side i tried to contact the customer care lots of times but no response and i mailed them too many times for that also no response  such a worst service from BOAT Simply they collected the product and than no response from their  side    
Smartdevices,1,CG,  One of the worst ear phones ever had The one bought on the road side would be worth more than what I paid for this Just a bit of pressure on the head of ear bud to push it inside the ear  entire ear phones goes dead  Which ear phones are meant to be just placed on ears with out pushing it in 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I have been a boat customer for more than   years and have bought about   earphones   one per year on an average   Definitely  I have to say this  The sound  Bass   Noise cancellation are some of the best features of Boat earphones  You can enjoy all your music tracks to the core   but mostly  less than a year  On a fine morning with a fresh mental state  when you are all set for your morning country ride there comes the hardest part  When you plug in your most loveable earphone to your device  You will find that one side of your earphone is not working  Oh man   WTH   I am all set to have a good day  But this is really disappointing   you will plug out and plug in a     times and you will do all the crazy stuffs that may make the earphone to work but still you are left with disappointment  This exactly happened with all my boat earphones in all these years  I would definitely recommend one to buy this earphone  if you are going to use this earphone for less than a year  Cheers  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Well  to start with  the piece looks good  durable  I ordered a green one  and I would give it all the stars for it  given the price range  You can blindly go ahead with it  if you are looking for a durable  good looking earpiece But  for me  these are not what I look for in a earphone  The sound quality is average as it feels as if I am using a below standard sound quality earphone  with a bass that  if used with these kind of earpiece  you will hate  To be frank  I have not used the earpiece coz it hurts my ears  I just use it for calls  nothing more  I used to love headphone listening to songs  but it will fade if I keep using this piece  I  previously  used  skullcandy pieces  and found it much better  obviously they do fall in the same price range  or a bit higher Verdict  Go for some other piece if you are only buying it for sound quality 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  These are the best budget earphones available  I got them for       in a lightening deal  I had previously ordered one of these for my wife  which we liked very much  which are still in good condition without any wear and tear  And the sound quality too is still the best  Hence saw this deal on Amazon  and without thinking further grabbed them during a TGIF sale  I can recommend these to any one without a doubt for the value for money we get out of these 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  THE PRODUCT DEVELOPED SNAG IN ONE OF THE EAR PLUG WITHIN     MONTHS  JAN OF PURCHASE             SECOND ALSO GAVE IN WITHIN ANOTHER     MONTHS  NOW DUE TO CORONA   OUTSTATION JOB GOT TIME TODAY TO VISIT THE SERVICE CENTER BUT THE GUY SAID I WAS LATE BY   DAYS  TODAY        FOR WITHIN   YEAR WARRANTY OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE REPLACED IN BETWEEN MY SON FOUND OUT THE NO OF SERVICE PROVIDER FROM INTERNET BUT GIVEN NOS HAD NO REPLY  HE ALSO WROTE AN E MAIL TO info imaginemarketingindia com ON  TH JAN      WELL WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD BUT DID NOT GET ANY REPLY NOW TODAY FINALLY can not DO ANYTHING will not GO FOR BOAT EARPLUGS ANYTIME HENCEFORTH  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This is a budget earphone and i was not expecting much from it  Bought this for calling purpose as a secondary earphone  I use Sony mdr xb  ap regularly which has great sound  But this boat earphone has no clarity in the sound  There is a little bit of extra bass but low and mid tones are very bad  One cannot experience instrument seperation and it feels like some echoed sound  Even the voice is not clear when used for calling 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Pros    Good sound quality   Thick cableCons    Pathetic mechanical design  the    mm jack comes out of female connector with slight twist  i had hard time to keep the connection stable while running   The rubber buds quality is so poor  It felt like a recycled tyreI would not recommend this product  i had a JBL C   SI earphone for   yrs and had not problems with the sound quality or mechanical stability  This boat product sucks 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Without a doubt  Best Earphone under      I have used JBL T    previously  it was good but it is one side bud because faulty and guys this issue is common with this particular model of JBL  Getting on to the Main Topic  so finally landed to buy this Boat     earphones and it was Worth a buy  Loved it   Excellent Bass  Clear Voice and most importantly a Sturdy Built Quality  I can assure you as m experiencing the same that it is built Quality is Top Notch  you ll not face the common issue with earphone s one side bud become s Faulty Overall Clear Sound  Good Bass and Excellent Built Quality Thanks
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The most stupidest product from boAt  The wire is so long you might as well plug it into the persons phone standing next to you  Due to its length it gets stuck here and there  The L type jack is not suitable if you want to keep this in your pockets  What an annoying product  Gift it to someone you hate The sound quality is very good  Delivery was on time  Neatly packed  The colour is very crisp too 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am giving review after few months  the mic play pause buttion stopped working after  or months  warrenty claimed but the replacement procedure takes so long that what to say  my one for replacement it tooked more then a month  buy and use it carefully may or maynot your one gets damage so soon     
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Excellent sound quality  I have ordered this in two quantity  blue and black  Thanks for an extra earbuds  The bass gives you ultimately shivering while playing in full volume  The only minus point is earbuds ear piece is little heavy  It falls down many times from your ear holes  because of its heavy weight  So you have to shove it very deep and tight 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Though I paid     which sounds reasonable for an earphone however seeing other reviews on other ear phone brands  it looks quite less  So as per the price I paid in August       the right ear piece has finally given way  Though I may not blame the makers totally as I have managed not maintaining it in the normal way  getting pulled by the bike handlebar   with the arm   However durability is a factor which the makers must consider while manufacturing as far as such wear tear is expected About the sound quality  it is decent in comparison to the price so as MTV bai says   Itne mein itnach milega  sounds apt  But then I believe in Pepsi tagline   Yeh Dil Mange More  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using  couple earplug in this range and I must say boat has grown and improved with time a lot This product has good built quality  and yes as mentioned the bass is really good and can easily rate   out of   The noise cancellation works well until i m not in too much traffic The color variants are cool  I have blue and green  I specially liked the metal stuff on top of the earplugs which offer a premium look The length of the wire good enough and no issue with having phone in pockets Cons  the only thing that was missing was volume up down button however we have pick and cancel button  well maybe i m expecting to much at this price  POverall  go for it for daily use  and more who loves bass 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  BOAT is an Indian brand   trust worthy   loved it Sound quality is very good at this price Rs        It is better than Realme  Redmi   JBL brand which comes under Rs      And very thankful to Amazon who has delivered the product within   hrs of order placed at Vasai Mumbai 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Using this from past   to   months and the headphone has stopped working  not able to hear the voice from other side rather own voice is echoing on both ends  Absolutely not happy with this and there is no option to return this product Loss of     Rs I would say and will not recommend to anyone further 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I had purchased these boat headphones on    june       Suddenly it has stopped working from one end after just   months  It has a warrenty of   year  I want this product to be replaced as soon as possible  I need headphones badly  Such a bad experience with amazon as i have done many major shopping from amazon  Just want this product to be replaced as soon as possible 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  If you have decided to buy this product it is important for you to know that  without any equaliser tweaks it is not going to feel like  yeah  this is the product they  some popular youtubers  reviewed giving this headphone     or     overall rating  well for me honestly I hated the sound quality coming out of it on  st impression  it felt like cheap local market headphones  unclear  the vocals of music felt very suppressed by the bass  even Spotify High quality streaming sounded like low quality and there was music distortion at    volume level  which gave me the feeling that this is the worst headphone I have ever seen  disappointed  dissatisfied and what not  I was thinking about returning it  But the Bass god  I Loved it         I loved it so much that i started to give my decision a second thought before I return it to the seller  I opened equaliser  turned down the volume to      still it is  hella loud trust me this headphone is the loudest among all of the headphones I have used in the past and sarted to tweak a little started with Bass  trible letting the music play in background on Spotify I noticed a huge difference in sound quality it definitely got a lot better  After tweaking equaliser  I will rate it like this      Sound quality     Bass Quality     Noise Cancellation Quality      Build Quality    Mic Quality    LOUDDurable wire Idk let us find out FINAL VERDICT THIS HEADPHONE IS FOR MUSIC   BASS LOVER STRICTLY   After using equaliser CASUAL GAMERS LOW ON BUDGET I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO STAY THE F   AWAY FROM THIS HEADPHONE  TESTED PC GAMES  BEFORE   AFTER USING EQUALISER PUBG  PUBG LITE  BATTLEFIELD  BUY ANYTHING ELSE OR WHATEVER 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  My headphones have never been able to outlive     months at a stretch  but this one was a total beast  Used it so rough that I thought it will not survive     month  But to my surprise it dragged me for almost   years and then died peacefully So glad that such quality products are still there in the market  Total value for money Updates   Bought another boAt series  and let us see how far it goes 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have heard very much about these headphones also have noticed many people having these headphones around their neck  The style and design of the headphones are unique and youthful  You can say it was designed to appeal the masses  For the price they have a very bassful experience  Me personally i also like to hear notes along with the bass so i would say these headphones are perfect for those who listen edm more often  The metallic earpieces However start to bother my earlids after some time  Since they are metal it kind of hurts me after some time of usage  They also tend to get very cold if you are sitting in a air conditioned room  Also i wish they had a angular earlids like the ones on some of its competitors  I also like they provide a ton of earbuds for the user to choose from 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Cheap quality product in this price range  One side stop working after   months I had purchased boat earphones before same happened with them first stops working in warranty and complete stops working after   year  do not go with boat if you do not want to waste your money And suggestion for boat thoda quality pr dhyan dijiya advertisement pr nhi
Smartdevices,4,OR,  PROS  Strong and sturdy build Looks great Flat cable less tangling Very long cable Good bass Comes with a packet of earbuds to choose from Earphone has micCONS  Sound quality is average  Very heavy buds  so they often slip out of ear Long earbuds means you can not use it when sleeping as it will dig into your earsAt this price  I would have recommended Philips Bass  Earphones which are the best bass treble earphones under  K  but apparently Philips do not sell it anymore  so I had to buy this one  If you want a decent earphone in budget then buy it  but if you are a perfectionist and do not mind the price  I would recommend the Signature Acoustics earphones  which are usually available at Rs            
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Overall the headset serves the purpose  if you do not have a good equalizer in your phone media device  you cannot get much out of this product  The biggest con of this product is that each earphone is heavy and falls off your ears every   to   minutes  If you need a headset temporarily  it is ok but I think there are way better choices  Cheers 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I have ordered this boat product for second time from Amazon last time when I used it  it was of good quality But this time boat basshead quality seems to be different than previous one I did not like it personally as compared to previous one sound quality is not that good as I have thought I do not know what has happened with this good quality product When I plug in to hear some music its not effective this time  I did not like it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have already lost my ear phone but I will still review it for the time it was with me the sound quality was very good  bass and everything was quite a best deal in that package and the after sales service was even outstanding as I got ear phone replace instantly and hassle free only one thing I have a problem with was the mic it does not record your voice loudly so I have to talk a bit loudly which was a bit annoying and embarrassing rest everything is good  I also suggested my friends to buy boat products   happycustomers
Smartdevices,3,OR,  As soon as i received the item pls check the left right earphone sound mine left was feable compared to right bass effects also i properly checked whther jack is not inserted also through another phone result is same so i ordered for replacement comparing right sound is ok and clear bass average but ok   stars bcoz defected headphone deliverd else   stars Got the replacement and working well 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Sound quality   noise cancellation and bass quality everything is great   This review is after   months of usage  After   months  one side stopped working   But no issue   Boat service center is great    They just replaced old ear phone with new one in   mins   Overall it is best ear phone and value for money
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It is good handsfree but this handsfree is heavy and it has matel body So it give you extra noice when you charging your leptop so that was disappointing sound quality is     i use sennheiser cx    s that was awesome if you have Price Range Then Go For It Con is heavy  Every thing else is good 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  SOUND QUALITY  NOISE CANCELLATION are good  bass quality is ok   but when I record  vedio audio  with this earphone  then some disturbing beep sounds are also recorded I totally dissatisfied for this kind of disturbance Even when I am  in conference meeting    this disturbing beep sounds are delivered  to the same meeting attendee  it disturbs the whole meeting Totally dissatisfied 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I donno why but I am writing its review after   freaking years     these were the best earphones I have ever had wired in ear BASS  TOP NOTCHTREBLE  GOODQUALITY  BESTthe only thing that i do not like was the weight     sunce the earplugs are metal so they are quite heavy and they caused a lil pain when I started using them but after using a month I was used to them    Overall they are the best budget earphones for bass lovers
Smartdevices,4,OR,  But using it for a while when the problems started to arise  i was looking for a platform to register my complaint and I also did the same on the company portal of both amazon and boat But no response  The helpline of your company is not viable as it does not pertain to customer satisfaction Moreover I stoppednusing them for a while Then when again I used them after some time they were perfectly fine  The problem is when I connect the earphone with my phone jack  volume up down  google voice over comes to play on its own Then now again when I have started using the earpgone frequently the same  Problem is occuring 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Reviewing after   months of use  Not a single damage or fault yetI m not a hard or vigorous user of earphones I use it for office calls and occasionally for watching movies and videosGood quality material with square wiring gives better durability without any special pouch or cases for storing  Heavy bass Good product for long lasting use
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Writing this review after   months of use It stopped working   no sound from both sides   Same experience with other Boat headphone also even after paying more amount if product is not durable then it is better to go for some low cost product which also works well for short time    Second drawback   weight is more so frequently fell down from ear   not convenient to keep for long duration  Bass quality is good 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I got mine a couple of days back  at          The Sound quality is very good  as much good as one could expect at this price range  The packaging was small  clean but box looked like a package for  rubber    if you understand that reference  In both colours  Black   White there are three pairs of large  medium and small size earbuds are given in box along with two anchors for earpieces  The earbuds does not feel that much comfortable but are okay  For me personally  they tend to slip out of ears too much  There is a clip for the wire  if you do not like it hanging out  P The wire does not feel like very good quality but feels rugged and durable  Overall quality seems in line with price range if you look at other products in price range  I would recommend these 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros For this price range  it gives very good listening quality It comes with different sizes of earbuds and a set of ear hooks for comfortable wearing The bass is actually good when placed properly in the ear Has good noise cancellation when hearing The tangle free wires do their job Cons It sits very awkwardly in the ear and can tend to fall out easily  The ear hooks also come in only one size so it may not fit everyone comfortably The earphones sit in the ear in such a way that you will never get the optimum sound quality without constantly holding the earphones in a certain way This could be just for the product I received  but when I am recording something  there is a constant static noise in the background  The mic also has a weird double tone quality and adjusts the volume sound when I record high notes  so it sounds like the recording is broken Overall  if you are buying this for purely listening purposes  it is a good buy  Otherwise you might need to consider other options 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The sound quality is average but the design has some fundamental issue  The ear piece will not stay in the ear at all  will keep falling off no matter whether you use the extra locks or not  I have used JBL Mi Sennheiser before and none of them has this weird issue  Not happy since I have to keep picking it up and sticking it back in the ear 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  This one is a great product from boat along with other that they provide  The bass is great from this price range of earphones  The build quality is great  Metal earpiece which are a bit heavy but can last a lifetime  The problem is they fall from your ears easily when there is a little pull on the wire   It has a flat wire so there is no mess of wires getting tangled  It also has a L shaped pin which can be easily slide into your pocket without the worry of pin getting damaged which happens with lot of earphones which has got a straight pin  The customer service is great  Easily replaceable in warranty period 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Bought this on Amazon for INR      Got the delivery of the product today   Packaging is good   Build Quality is surprisingly Very Good and you will feel like you are getting more worth than what you paid for   But sound quality is average  Its not pleasing but at the same time it is not disappointing either  It just gets the job done  One very key thing here is that the     mm plug is L shaped which suits my MacBook Air laptop perfectly as the     mm port is on the left side of the laptop  I just got the delivery  so I cannot comment on the durability yet  I bought this only as a standby headphones for my laptop  So as a light user I presume this product will age well  Will let you guys know if there is any update on that  If you are a headphones listening enthusiast then go for something else like JBL or Sennheiser by investing more money  If you just want a standby headphones with very good build quality  that just gets the job done without investing much money  then go for this  Thank you 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I had ordered Ant Audio earphones for    Rs from Amazon itself The packing of Ant audio was far better as that of boat Ant Audio felt more comfortable in my ears The wire felt more durable on Ant Audio The Sound quality is just    better on Ant Audio  Boat is not bad aswell I purchased Ant Audio for       in Lightning deal Whereas  Boat has maintained its price at       which seems to be overpriced now Problem with Ant Audio    Boat earphones are straight  The earbud goes straight into your ears   Ant audio has given a tilt of    degrees to it is earbuds  they say it is for comfort of ears  But somehow  this inclination made the metallic part hit my ears and these earphones used to irritate me after prolonged usage    This is the only reason why I had to return my Ant audio earphones and settle down for Boat  I hope Boat earphones prove themselves as comfortable and durable  as their pricing 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The worst earphone you can buy ever  I have bought   earphones for myself and for my people and all of them stopped working partially or completely after some time say   months or so  They claim that we will pick the product and will and return but they do not do  And they have very few service center and those are very far from my place or even for my people s places 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Have been using it for last    months now and doing well  My experience with other earphones is that over a few months the delicate wire connections at mic element or at the buds get broken and then the earphones are useless  This happens with even the expensive ones  But this one has wide flat cables which has made it last so much  Another benefit of flat cables is they do not tangle  So after a looonnngg use a big thumbs up from me 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  It is exactly just   year passed and the left ear piece suddenly stopped working  Raised a ticket with Boat  Imaging  on  th Nov       purchased date   Nov      and they updated that warranty has expired  Somewhere I had seen the warranty for wired boat ear phones are of   years but found in Amazon site   it is of only   year I am so unlucky that  it got kaput immediately after one year warranty period passed  So now I have to purchased a new one 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Its weird that sometimes after I connect it  volume and Bixby are automatically disturbed  I hear static noise when I have connected it to my S    The buds are also too big to be used with a motorcycle helmet  Sound quality is okok  Not talking about the bass  Bass is extreme  They will not replace or take it back so be careful about what you order  do not buy  Went useless after   months 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  In my viewFirst I want to say ignore ignore this negative points The product is really good  I used last   days and I love this sound quality of the earphone very much If we talk about comfort  do  they really played here these are so comfortable   Design cable is good  it is triangle free and easy to handle itIt have impressive design and it does not fall from your ear even while running   Button is provides a single button but can so many things with this single button if you are a Android user    A Double tap to play next songB Triple tap to play previous songC Long press to access Google assistance and directly apply  operationD Single tap for play and resumeE The button is comfortable very smooth to play And I am very satisfying with this ProductThank you Amazon and Delhivery
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Though i have rated them lesser on bass  noise cancellation  its in comparison with some of the best in mkt  But at the sametime those are expensive and this is reasonably affordable  it is bang for the buck and very durable  I have been using this over a year now  Nothing happened so far  Most other even the best have not lasted over a year for me except sckull candy  Compared to likes of those this is value for money  This one I gor for my spouse 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  One cannot go wrong with these earphones  They fit well  sounds really good in the price range and above all the quality of the product is great  mistakenly got these submerged in water a few dozen times and they just come out fine  although not recommended for someone to use it wet but an accidental dropping in water or getting wet in rain is not a problem at all The bass is cooolllll
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Overall quality is very good but ear tips are hard to handle because of their weight  but it justify its metal ear tip with high bass delivery and clear sound as well  But if you have habit of enjoying music while sleeping then please guys do not buy this  Slightly pain in ear after   hr use  it have and large ear tips 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought this earphone by friend suggest  I am using this earphone and have not faced any problems yet  Mostly I used headphone during traveling for listening music and watching videos  After two months of usage this headphone  I am giving review  I got the product well packed by Amazon  I ordered Neon Lime Color and Its a decent color  In packed box got   pairs extra earbuds with different sizes  Sounds are amazing  Sounds are high with Extra Bass but we can adjust  Sounds are much clear than others earphones I have ever used  No noises during calling  Length of the headphone is     meters  That is perfect for everyone  Wires are sturdy and strong  Jacks are metal and strong 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Great product  Flat cable is so easy to untangle  Sound quality is amazing  Noise cancellation might not be present as a feature but if earphone is playing on full volume then surrounding noise can not be heard  But it is a suggestion please do not listen on full volume for longer periods of time  Bass is quite good if you listen to Rock   heavy metal genres or even Bollywood party songs  Overall a great buy under Rs     
Smartdevices,1,OR,  First thing these earphones ear buds are not comfortable to our ears  Oftenly removed from our ears   Every   minutes you have to put them properly  And we can not keep them morethan    minutes   You gea ear pain  Who likes to listen music long time do not take this   Basically ear phone design is not good  that is why you can not get any better results even change the caps  Music quality also average Most of the YouTube techies are guving over publicity and fake reviews 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  do not search for information regarding this earphones You can buy it if you are a casual user Bass is not so clear and it also produces bass when not necessary If you are purchasing it for playing PUBG then do not go for it MI Basic which cost around     will be better You can not listen songs for a long time because after   hour you will remove the earphones because it is very uncomfortable I will give   Star to it is built quality Only buy it if you are a casual user Or you can go for Mi basic  JBL C   si   Skullcandy  Ant audio and even the realme buds    These brands are much more comfortable and provides good sound do not waste your money in this earphones   trust me you will literally fell pain in your ears 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  JUST AWESOME Do not believe in others comment     It has good BASS     But not irritating Bass    One should go for this item if your budget is below      rs       I BOUGHT IT FOR    RsSOUND QUALITY                  FOR THIS PRICE RANGE        Some compare this sound with      to      Sony  jbl  beats        Etc        Within this price range it will be on the top     DURABILITY                  TANGLE FREE WIRE      Even      Sony earphones    Have not such type of quality     JUST GO FOR IT
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Actually the product is too good  super bass  good sound quality noise cancellation  everything a good headphones has but get damaged after     months of use  so if are expecting  year use then I think it will hardly last cuz I have bought   pieces and did not lasted more than   month after   months the sound quality fades and ultimately to no sound so from my experience buy it only if you have no budget  pleanty of money to waste  it will give the best in its working days so I am giving it   stars  but if ure  searching for a long lasting headphones then it is not ur thing my friend
Smartdevices,3,OR,  After doing a lot of research keeping in checks of my past experiences I did not want to go for high end earphones and while doing so I got to view this one  Boy I tell you do not fall for th reviews as I did  cos sound and durability are good   however the material might be something where this falls flatter Basically the buds do not fit into my ears and especially when you go for a walk and you need to enjoy music  you will hate this as the heavy weight in buds will will be always be coming out and does not fit in properly  Then again there is a holder in middle which is basically useless and heavy as it can be which pulls the earbuds down  The design of this earphones are flawed Finally it did not serve my purpose so DISAPPOINTED
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Writing this after     years of use  still works fine Over the years  you might find       drop in bass as compared to the new  due to coil aging  but hardly noticeable  obviously you can always compensate the same with a proper Equalizer  if you really need it hard core But this product is history  hope you can find these As I have heard that boat being under warranty  give a replacement  have never claimed a warranty was lucky enough  and used them with care 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This earphone is excellent for listening to music or watching movies  The bass quality is good But for calling purpose it is worst  The mic is not good  If the mic moves to other direction then the receiver does not hears any voice  To talk to someone i have to hold the mic near to my mouth I am fade up of this and hence planning to purchase a new one So go for this earphone only if you want to listen songs or watch movie 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I just recived it   days ago nd So far I am loving it Sound quality is also very good  Noise cancellation is also quite good No question on quality Only con I have found so far is that being metallic it feels kind of irritating in ear when used for long time  It often falls down from my ear and when I press it tightly the sound goes off wondering whether it is my fault or the product has some problem 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  In my opinion this earphones are good  Because their quality is very good Bass is best in this price range but if you want comfortable fit and you use earphones for a long duration then do not go for this  Because this are not comfortable they frequently fell down from ears  I had tried all the earbuds and wing tips given in the box but they are not fitting comfortably in ears  So Final Answer for this product is their quality in case of sound  Bass is very good but if you want comfortable fit then you should not go for this 
Smartdevices,1,CG,   I want REFUND   No manual is there  The most important part of any  earphones is  fitting   of earcap in Ears  which was not working at all from all possible ways  No noise cancellation  Bass quality is not upto the mark  Kindly refund as soon as possible 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Bought this product a year back through Flipkart  The headset had been working perfectly since last   year till today when the left side stopped working  that is when I ordered this one To be frank I am pretty pleased that it worked for about   year as I almost drop the phone every weak or two with the headphones attached to it  Because of this  the wires became loose near the     mm connector Overall Impression   Sturdy Built    Strong Wires    You get   pair of buds  unlike any other I have bought     Great Bass and sound quality at this price 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am giving   star for the after sales service and the product quality   I bought the product and within   month the left earphone stopped working and as instructed in the warranty I raised the request and uploaded the invoice downloaded from the Amazon site  Later I received a mail stating that the invoice is not valid or clear  They are not going to replace your product if it is faulty in the warranty  I have bought   Bluetooth headset    Bluetooth Speaker    Bluetooth Earpod and   wired earphone from Boat and the only thing still working is the Bluetooth speaker maybe because I paid a hefty amount on that  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Awesome earphone   it is worth every penny that you spent on it Previously ordered from Flipkart and got scammed by fake product but this time Amazon delivered it before the delivery date If you are a music lover it is not for you man The bass is not upto the mark but if you are a gamer boy then you will definitely enjoy it   The build quality is amazing   In this price range no other brand will give tangled free wires and metal finish Due to metal it is bit heavy but after applying ear hooks you will definitely use it while running and gym Overall it come with a   year warranty but this will go more than   years   
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Exactly    days of use and the right one stopped working   What can we say about the quality    Connected to seller by their site  they picked it up for exchange and it is been    days now  no update  Looks like I lost my money  not getting anything back 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Quite a sturdy and quality product at the pricepoint  Very good sound on call also  noise cancellation is effectively experienced during calls  My only negative point for this product is that it is desigend as such that the in ear pieces tend to slip out  at least for me 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Here I am using this Earphones since    days  so i am sharing some pros and cons of this product so you can make your decision of purchasing it  PROS   bass quality is good   sound quality is good compared other in this price range long cable and gold plated pinCONS   earbuds can not fit in every one s ear  you need to change it from extra buds which comes with it sound quality is not too good compared to JBL and Sennheiser  AFTER END OF ALL I WOULD SUGGEST YOU IF YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS ONLY SOUND GO TO JBL AND SENNHEISER OR ELSE THIS ARE COOL   Overall rating to this Earphones by me          
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Extremely poor Sound quality of this earphone  There is no super extra bass  bass is not punchy  trebles are not well balanced  In terms of clarity this earphones are not too good  People s and brand created a hype for this earphone  In real world not extra bass on this  if uhh listening bass heavy songs in high volume  bass are comes overwhelming and muddy  There are couples of option on this budget like   Blaupunkt EM   and ant audio w    Do not go with positive reviews on Amazon and flipkart  Total waste of money 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Great sound quality    i have to keep my laptop volume on around    when I use this so you can imagine how great the voice is    the voice does not crack at all    you can also hear the background beat in a song clearly     just a great purchase    go for it
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I have used this product for     weeks  for   weeks it works properly  good bass  nice sound quality  but now I am not using this product  because it is mic has gone guys  for last few days mic not working  I have been using this earphones for my gaming purpose  and when I am playing pubg i can not speak anything to my friends   i can hear everything   but I can not talk to them  then i checked amazon for return  this product is not returnable  i bought this product for      and my money gone wastedI think footpath earphones just     rupees can work more than this item 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I purchased this headphone on   Feb       After using for one and half month  one side of earphone stopped working  Due to lockdown I could not contact to customer care as well as via mail  After lockdown was over  my product was taken by them for replacement  It took one month for replacement and when I received replaced product it has the same problem  Like it was never replaced  I believe purchase a normal earphone of    Rs instead of purchasing boat  If you really want a branded earphone then look for sony or philips  They are far better than from this scam and fraud brand  Never buy boat products 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Please ignore all the negative reviews about this product because what it is offering at such a competitive price is just awesome Sound Quality   You can hear all highs and lows in Bohemian Rhapsody that is all I need to say   The volume is on the higher side so you have to keep the volume a bit lower than other earphones  Material   it is buds are made of metal and the flat cable keeps it tangle free  It seems durable because you can not see any loose ends or no part is exposed Microphone   It offers great noise cancellation and the receiver could hear me clearly Overall   Overall value for money  Do go for it if you are on a little tighter budget or you can use it as a secondary earphone if you are an audiophile 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It worked fine for   weeks but    just after a moderate use     one of the earphone goes blank in between  Its definitely not acceptable  I have a feeling I have received a defected one     when it works     it produces a good output but reliability is a big problem 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Loving it totally These is my  nd time   I have ordered it My first lasted for   years Delivery was done within    hours of ordering Even though my friends have said me to try other earphones  i love only boat It is hard to beat the quality of these earphones in these segment with its bass and features Totally loving it and it will worth your every penny Thank you Boat 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Material is good quality plus flat wire of it it tangle free if you regularlly bundled it will be  Tangle na  but its a tangle free wire sound quality is good bass is also nice and  Its sound good durability its also good but its haveing press button that cut call not make call it play button in music and video but     because of pressing this button its look like button its fully plane looking you can see pic i gaved it  it will be malfunction really very very  Rare and  some time  Not  evry time   just inform  Not so serious its occur its have   pair of ear buds  of red color in middle of earbuds and   are black you can see pic and other supporter clip for ur ears also ther  Biggest con is  Its  Falling from ear  If wear and run  Its also depends on earbuds size    star for tough headphoneand n sound also total  star   pair of ear bud i lost   of   single pair 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I seriously hate these headphones  Painful  so damn painful in the ear  Comes out of the ear  no matter whichever earbud you use  sometimes I feel it is a problem with my ear  but then  all the other headphones do fit properly  Cannot be used for too long as I already said  ears would start paining  I do not understand how can this thing have   n above rating  Sound quality is not what is expected and mentioned  Bass       Treble       If the volume is high and someone calls  it will burst your ears  and when you talk on the mic  the other person can hear lots of back noise and distortions  And the worst part  Amazon did not even had a return policy for this  just replacement  what wud I do by replacing and getting the same product that hurts my ears
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Decent product at this price range  I really do not see noice cancellation during calls  Bass is okay  If you increase the volume  then it is not soo good  If you are looking only to listen music or watch movies  it is a good to go product  If you are looking for any office work kind of stuff  then it is not soo good product  It is very hard and very much durable even though you use it rough and tough  So the question is  Is it okay to buy  You decide 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent head phones  really did not expect this kind of quality  guys it is really awesome head phones  After putting this in your ears you will completely involve a movie or music  you will feel like you are in DTS theater  such kind of quality it has  I am very very happy with this head phones  Thanks allot Boats for creating such kind product with less price  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This is indeed the best possible headphone at this price range Pros    Sound quality and Frequency response are good    Low price Cons The size of the earbuds is very large as compared to other headphones  Due to this  it is not comfortable to use it while working out  It easily falls out  Hence I started to use the wings provided  but wings caused my ears to hurt 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   The earphone is very nice in its Design sound quality but just that it is not comfortable to wear  It keeps falling off  to support it comes with a supporter or whatever it is called   wearing that brings pain to ur ears  Other than that the earphone is very good  But not comfortable enough to wear it and forget about it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was a Sennheiser user since more than   years but upon a friend s strong recommendation i went for Boat this time The product was delivered and after unpackaging  i was pretty impressed with the build abd design But then i put them in my ears and as soon as i played the song  i was BLOWN AWAY   The BASS is just WOW This is specifically for people with a craving for Bass  If you are not a Bass lover do not go for this 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  does not have a button for volume adjustments or for calling ending a call or skipping tracks  Extremely disappointed with that   is not that supposed to be part of even a basic earphone Am stuck with this as I can not return the product and can only replace it   If only
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Given the price point  it meets the expectations  I would have given it   if it had better noise cancellation with microphone  Calling over microphone at high volumes is disappointing as noise cancellation is poor and that leads to high distortion regarding the sound  it lacks quality at high frequencies namely  guitar music or any other string instrument music  Again keeping the price in mind  I should not really be compalining about this  Overall it is a   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  NOW THIS IS WHAT BEST QUALITY LOOKS LIKEI RECIEVED IT TODAY              DELIVERY WAS ON TIMETHANK YOU AMAZON BOATBEST SOUND QUALITYYOU COULD GET UNDER    VERY GOOD BASSGREAT SOUND QUALITY GREAT FAN OF BOAT PRODUCTSAND VERY DURABLE TOOI AM USING  SAME MODEL SINCE   YEARSNOW I PURCHASED SAME FOR MY BROTHER THANK YOU AMAZON AND BOAT FOR PROVIDE SUCH GREAT PRODUCTS  IN VERY REASONABLE PRICE YOU WILL NEVER REGRET BUYING IT

Smartdevices,1,OR,  The product was packed very bad and when it came it was a defective one  I do not want to comment on the Brand as the product can be defective at times but the seller had opened this  product and packed as if he wanted to stuff and send it even though he knew that it was a non working earphone  I returned and bought wecool earphones   do not go for it   I am disappointed with the seller 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Writing after six months of use  One side will always stop working  Though you can replace the earphones by raising a request on official boat website  But that also can be done only till one year  Not durable not made for rough use

Smartdevices,5,OR,   st of all   i am just a one day listener of it  so giving the review of it by listening thoroughly I am a sennheiser cx      sony xb   ap user and also use some xiomi earphone  As a basshead i like bass in music but also fond of treable  for that purpose sony xb   is utterly dumb   bass was really good but treable was very bad  using equaliser also can not do any good things  sometime bass was so good that music and voice can not come so nicely so for pure music listener sony is not that good  i am saying aftee uaing it for  mnth But when i listen the Boat     the bass was rellay good like the sony xb  ap   i can not believe how a cheap earphone can comepte the mich higher one   but believe me guys   there r so many review of sony for thr bass but still i think for      you should go for boqt exactly the bass is same for thr cheap price ans sound also very good   but thr treable was not good like sonyxb       if you use equaliser  give some tweak  and it sound amazing   no need of buying sony for that extra price    pls buy it and then believe that what i am saying        keep listening 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  One of the best headphones in this price segment  I did a lot of research and finally settled for this one   Tangle free cable  Really durable and robust yet beautifully designed with perfection  Sound quality is awesome   Go for it if you have budget of around         
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Honestly saying  I am a Bose QC   II user  Since I did not wanted to pay so much on a wired earphone for my budgeted Xiaomi phone  I bought these earphone and to be honest  I did not expect this to be this much awesome  The bass though  it is so lit  Noice cancelling is also quite good but you should be cautious while on the road as this cancels the noise in such a way that even the sound of a horn can be felt so dull  If I have to nitpick between boAt and Sony in a budget  I would go with the boAt  But since I am a Bose user  I am not satisfied with the noise cancellation as that of the Bose but for the rest  this is damn good  A try would be worth it 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Technically it is good but they are not sitting in ears as comfortably as jbl one   This one not have turned earheads shape   so it is uncomfortable to sit in ears   As they are not sitting properly in ears   i got ears problem   i seen for refund but replacement is available but not refund  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product     Screen Flickering is the most common problem   Half of the times  TV does not start with a single button press    Booting takes atleast    seconds   Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time    Audio is dud   Not sufficient for my   X   ft bedroom   System lag is the maximum in this class of TV sEdit            Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of          as against   k which I paid for the TV  All I have to do now is to live with a defective TV  as I had invested in the wallmount and the allied services  OnePlus SettledEdit            Product is back in stock  Amazon accepted for replacement after technician report  But  defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped  Awaiting further details  Brand is not at all acting in the customers interest  Very bad response for OnePlus Edit          Received the replacement TV from Amazon and the TV if working fine as of now  I installed it on the wall by myself  A bit of lag and sound issues  but the screen stuttering is gone 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Problems with OnePlus Tv   Y   observed in few hours of use Pros      Picture quality is undoubtedly good   Sound is fine enough for a closed room Cons     Lags too much     Some times restarts automatically     While watching YouTube screen and sound disappears for   to   secs   power on and off is also tricky    Some time disconnects from wifi and reconnect by its ownMaybe in later updates they provide some fix for all these issues 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  TV is beautiful with minute bezels I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to  gb ram and lower clocked processor  can not complaint at this price point  Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update  Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow But hold bluetooth was very functional  Might be as it is bluetooth      TV was able to connect to    devices at a time    mobile    bluetooth speaker and remote  that is great Coming to sound  Speaker quality is not upto mark  You have multiple options to enhance audio  dolby  surround  presets  dialogue enhancer etc  probably that is the reason oneplus skipped    mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker  You should go RCA audio adapters if you want    mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter  That would cost additional if you want to If you look for picture quality  minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you For power users and those who use only     jack to connect speakers look else where Update  Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy  I am not able to connect to new devices  It is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I will be brief here Unboxing No wall Mount No Display cables Plastic stands Thin TV Pros Contrast Ratio is Amazing  Black level is amazing Viewing angles r fine Awesome Colour accuracy Latest Android version Cons Poor quality Speakers Little bit laggy  probably the OS The panel is awesome  TV will not lag when playing video  and its really okay  android phones have similar issues As for speakers  why would you use inbuilt speakers What matters most is Contrast Ratio  Colour range  viewing angles  and clarity They r all good in this price range  no   k   k    FULL HD TV could do better AMAZON INSTALLATION I did not get the wall mount  because installation guys were charging me for it TV is good  Amazon Service is getting poorer 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  First to review   y   as my experience with    inch So far i liked the Tv Tv is by default on energy saving picture mode  change to desire mode to get best picture experience  as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than MI   realme me Sound quality for my living room is more than enough  dolby atmos work carm with my Tatasky HD channels as they support dolby audio The Lag is fixed to much extent last input memory is also fixed  TV remembers the last input before switching off The installation was bit crisp as the guy did not turn on the promised date  so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated Cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth Rs    was provided free by the installation team Installed and the demo was given very promptly Also to be noted this    inches has different graphic processor than    inches G   Mp Updating my experience of   days  Experienced lag nly twice in   days TV takes a approx of   min to get ON there is a bit motion blur  which would be fixed by update  as it arises due to the DNR in the settings Sound output is overall good at this range can not expect soundbar like bass Pre Book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko Picture quality is just awesome  with setting proper backlight  contrast etc Blacks are properly seen black This has VA panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles  VA Panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction this TV does the same Viewing angle can not be reviewed from my end as I did see blur when viewd at     angle which is obvious for VA panel Data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this TV As of now no alexa support for this TV as there is no option to login to oneplus account  so my free echo dot is not of use with this TV as of now  may be they will provide the update to this Updating my review with some test done   RGB colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this TV  As you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color   motion blur is too much in this TV  expect to be fix via update    TV remote is Bluetooth and IR both  i turned of my bluetooth of Remote and using on IR as it is draining battery  when on IR you can not use Google assistant function    No support for Echo dot as of now confirmed  hopefully will be in update    No data saver option yet    backlight bleeding is present at     which is common for LED Tv    color reproduction is good too Updating my review to some clarification and my experience         As echo dot is not compatible and no  from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with Y series  i returned my echo dot for full refund   Those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received  kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv  you vll get it for free   Those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly       rs  please return your echo dot too they remaining approx     rs will be refunded then only   I connected my JBl sound bar and watched movies on Prime   I bet the dolby atmos did its work       and its natural you can not expect soundbar sound at   k    pre book cashback of     rs is credited to my amazon pay balance 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  After    days usage     Display is good not best   Sound could have been better    Gamma Engine Not performed well   UI is Decent Modern Lightweight UI     Netflix Amazon Prime YouTube and few apps are Preloaded   Inbuilt Chromecast Performing Well   bezels Design perfect   Best Budget Android Smart TV   Major advantage of this TV is Google assistant   Works like a charm everywhere and you do not have to type    Some Bugs Present in TV OS
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I got it delivered by    july  Shipping was good but then bright spots started showing from the next day  Product quality is not good too  I advise you not to buy this oneplus TV s
Smartdevices,1,OR,  ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv  Y model Here is a list of issues with your product    connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv is not connecting through Samsung smart view  always says unable to connect  try again  And even through the google home  it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos    Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode  Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what  windows is not recognising the tv  It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows could not  using third party play store app     To my bad  even through third party play store app  it is laggy half of the times    And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app  Its a wonders  t app  do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can not access files through the connect app on this tv    And sound  it has options by the name  dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus  fix this in your mind  these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage    On Youtube  video quality is limited to     p  best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play  K  only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv    Opening and closing apps  is like suspense thriller movie scene experience  you will be waiting to know when it will respond sometimes suspense extends to      seconds    Viewing angles  acceptable for this price    Colors  Green is worst of all and then red   black is good  blue colors are worst  yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable     Display quality  If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade  you will get the exact same feeling  I promise you this     Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive  hard disk or HDMI and play the  k or full HD videos  This is the only way that this display can make you happy     And the remote  the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page  It just exists with void function assigned to it     Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance     out of    times  it took      seconds to launch it     Opening an app  Fix in your mind that it will take at least          Once you connect Bluetooth accessory  you have to remove the device from the list  if you want to connect it to other device  you will not have an option to disconnect 
Smartdevices,3,OR,     Picture quality is good  Look   Feel is good  I would quote  Best in this segment TVs   I have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment    Sound is      With Dolby Digital Plus enabled  it is better    TV build quality is good  Viewing Angles are good too     K Videos will be reset to     p and this is the maximum resolution for any video    Only    GB memory is available out of  GB    Oxygen Play is useless    There is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto    Accessing Tv with Oneplus connect App is   out of    Its a disaster    Wall Mount is free  It will be brought by installation provider  do not she will extra bucks for wall mount or installation     Apps take     sec to open  I am expecting optimization over next updates     USB Ports does not support FAT   Memory sticks  Pendrive  Hard Disk  or Phone   I am disappointed for this one     Max viewing distance can be   feet   My vision is     for both eyes     Though Google Play Store is given  you cannot install even google chrome  I see only Chinese apps are available even in google play store  do not expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone     No issue with remote and response time is good too  Remote build quality is good too     No heating issues noted so far     Supports only     Ghz band WiFi     No manual power switch  If remote does not work  it will be a hell with Tv     Chromecast has      sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse touch pad Suggestion    If price is not a issue  go for Samsung or LG Suggestion    Want to enjoy premium experience  buy premium Tv  do not expect to find it from Chinese brands  Time is money  the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in YouTube  consider adding that amount to the TV you buy Hope my review will be a help 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Brilliant TV at affordable price   first sale TV was returned back as it was defective one  Brought it  nd time  Its totally worth it 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Product is on price   k     inch y Pros Nice picture quality Awsm dolby surround soundNo problem with casting with you tubeCons Croma cast from mobile laging Connect app not working Data saver not available in    y After   days  After dwnlg oxygen plan from play store croma cast is working without laging Connect app is also working now Data saver not found to   y 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Tv is awesome at this price   Among all the competitors in this range of tv   oneplus tv is best    Viewing experience   Sound   Performance   FluenceAll this upto mark I am giving   star because of the following reason    Oneplus connect app is not working with tv   I am unable to find any datasaver option   Available storage is less
Smartdevices,1,OR,  One star because of poor installation serviceI ve received a call of installation guy at   am he said he will be at location after     hour so I said ok please come waiting of him after   hours he did not came   stop picking the call  Suddenly after half n hour again I received the call he asked sir did engineer call you   visit your place I saidhl he called me at      am but he did not come   even not picking my call I am trying him alot after long conversation of half n hour he arranged another guy he gaves me the contact of another guy again I have called him he is saying sir I will be there after     hour which is completely hard for me too wait I was getting late for office as you know the problem of covid    offices fire there is worker well after talk to with him I have send him location again he called me after   hour   said sorry I am not coming of asked why    Guy s word was talk to my boss    Brother who is your boss    I would I know again after    min  I have received call again sir I am visiting your place for installation I was surprised that whole Amazon company engineers visiting my home    Well again   min he called me   said sir I am not coming wtf    This whole scene was of    am to     pm then finally engineer came  pm   installated the led the whole wait was of only   screws wow amazon please improve your service which is totally sucks I have missed my office   led performance is good but the speaker sound is not up to the marks picture quality is good
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The video quality is good but  sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume  I have viewed Online content and seen DTH tv they  gives true colors and you will truly love it Dolby sound quality is enough even for living room   For DTH opt for a Dolby supported settop box  I am using airtel xtream box   k which is only      for airtel thanks customer  SOFTWARE lags at times and when you select Live TV at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen  Was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect  OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update  The viewing angles are ok but this is VA panel so nothing like IPS panel  OnePlus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P  color gamut   Google assistant works fine too  The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience  After sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era  Overall worthy contender 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Was eagerly waiting for this Tv  its economically priced and I got it for     k  super thin and lite weight     Thin Bezels and a absolute delight  Audio for a small room is great  bigger room it seems to be quiet less  Been using it whole day  just that one plus connect did not work with my iPhone and content from pendrive also not viewable at all  not sure if its supposed to be like that or there is some issue with the product Called one plus customer care  who told One plus connect will not work for iOS  and suggested to long press the home button and select one plus server to connect android and to my surprise iOS also can get connected and works flawlessly Moving on to the pen drive issue after a lot of research  trial and errors It works only on the format FAT   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Bought during first sale on  th July This TV is a blot on the name of One Plus  they should not have launched any product with such poor quality Picture quality is very poor  colors does not look natural at all  tried all the color settings  May be good for a monitor but not definitely good as a TV Sound quality is the biggest setback  it sounds like a  rd rate speaker and sound is not balanced  There is no clarity in the sound  you will not be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen Frame of TV is not durable  it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute Summary  do not expect anything good from this TV  this product does not deserve the One Plus brand name  One Plus should recall this product to maintain their brand image I would have returned this product if there was an option 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Oneplus is settled for this cheap built quality it comes with plastic body screen is not at all good if you pressure you can see liquid like flowing which we see in cheap quality products sound is too worst in an olden days when you full the volume you can get bad sound with disturbance now you can experience same with this tv
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Ordered on   th and got it by   th Afternoon  here is an honest review But before that  here is a few tips for people who are going to buy it you will get an Echo Dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time  read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you did not order the echo dot from your end and obviously did not get it with the TV To use the One Plus Connect app  you have to update the TV first  the OTA will be there when you turn on the TV for the first time After that  open the connect server app on the TV  and then open the Connect app on the phone and it would work Again  do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers The type sync function use the phone to type on the tv through the Connect App  does not work as of now  but would start working in the next app update  Head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details If you talk about hardware  the TV is flawless  those who are complaining about the TV simply have a bigger room that the TV is designed for  You can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume is not sufficient for your room  For me  it is more than enough The display is top notch and the colors are vibrant  it is truly bezel less and looks beautiful About the software  there are a few misses here and there  but I am sure it can be fixed through a software update ScreenCast lags a lot  I am waiting for an update to see if it is fixed To people who think that the TV lags a lot  think of the TV as a phone with   GB RAM  if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time  the phone would lag  same is the case with the TV it is a value for money for those who do not want to spend a fortune to get a TV with a good display 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Firstly I did not receive my Amazon Echo Dot at no cost as promised So I am really pissed off however I liked the tv  good in quality and sound is pretty loud too it is absolutely slim and sleek Beautifully designed Kudos to designed team Easy to browse through apps and quick and easy to connect to phone especially one plus phones Screen cast is just a click away got to do some more research on One Connect App it is giving me some hard time to connect to the TV 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  when box was opened by service engineer yesterday after   days waiting time  product was in damaged condition  No replacement was given and refund of Rs       is being initiated as promotional offer echo cost to be borne and no replacement of the same will be given 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I bought this TV in the first sale on  th July and have been loving it  Amazon installation was prompt and it was set up the same day as the delivery  It is pretty light and slim  as given in the specs The picture quality is fabulous  colors are right and everything about the display is better than normal  As a normal user  you would not notice any point of complaint regards to display Speakers are loud enough  and we are bound to mostly use it at     of the maximum volume  Dolby surrounds sound is an added benefit that does enhance the sound experience of the TV It runs Android     out of the box with Oxygen Play as the skin and the UI is pretty simple  It automatically fetches major information from the apps that you add to the home screen given you have signed in if required  The animations and transitions between application is sleek and there is no lag whatsoever  If you have used an android phone  the UI is no alien and the navigation will seem very familiar The connectivity ports provided are ample and the WiFi reception is also pretty strong  I do not know about the bells and whistles that other TVs come equipped with  but as a normal user who wants to enjoy his shows  videos  and cinema on a smart TV from all the contemporary sources like prime video  Netflix  youtube  etc   this is the perfect option 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It just got delivered on the second day of sale fixed also  installation was done above   feet   Sound quality is not good   Remote is not actual bluetooth as it does not sense        With this price range we could have gone with the other brands   Only buy if you are    lover other wise its not worth  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  No audio out for the TV never tust a new brand on an entry level   if picture quality is your only pripority then go for it because that sound is worst as hell   I do not consider price point because       is not a small amount for many people  I planned to connect it to a external speaker but the port is missing  No digital audio out nor the traditional    mm out  Highly disappointed in audio category  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Overall Analysis and Reviews for all prospective buyers     Picture Quality  The TV is definitely a worthy purchase as its Picture Quality is by far the best in class in compared to other competitors Build Quality too is Good The bezel and screen is definitely a Masterpiece as the Bezels are indeed Minimum   the way the screen is built is extremely Unique and different than other competitors can not comment on Viewing Angles as honestly I am not an expert also most people watch TV directly in straight direction and all these Viewing Angles talk is just a gimmick to confuse you all    OSEarlier reports were that the TV is very laggy especially w r t   inch however I did not experience much lag  One needs to understand that in this segment all competitors offer similar config of Ram and Processor which are definitely not high end HOWEVER like how it has been hyped on Lag part    I found it to be rather untrue as Lag exists but not to a huge extent OnePlus own software optimization is amazing as really clean and bloat free The TV remembers the last input and so turns on by default on the said input mode on boot up Tv has a unique style of Boot Up and Shut down method as on single power off press it seems TV is more on standby mode and only on Long Press of power off will the TV shutdown completely Boot up timing is good as its not too delayed    Sound   Major let down as sound is definitely not at all upto the mark however this is problem which is common amongst all competitors as each hv low Quality speakers only I already have a soundbar so this aspect anywhich ways had   impact as all competitors fail in sound aspect in these cost segment of TVs totally per my experience    Accessibility of Ports   Perhaps the major let down for me are the accesibility of the ports as they are not at all User Friendly and not readily accessible specially for people who have opted for Wall Mount like in my case The downward location of Port is the most Negative aspect for me However as I hardly use ports much so again not a major impact however for others it can seem to be a problem mainly for users who have more requirements of port like hdmi and all however with an HDMI extender you will be good to go just an investment of         rs for an extender may be required Table Top installation people have nothing to be worried off  This is least concern for them    Connectivity   Though a single band wifi Router Exists  the same works absolutely fine and   loss or issues atleast till now    Installation   Installation was a bit challenge mainly due to screw up by Third party responsible for installation however with Amazon Escalation it was handled timely and despite hiccups TV was installed on the scheduled date only by EOD there is a lot of confusion with regards to Wall Mount  well let me be clear that Wall Mount is totally Free and nothing needs to be paid at all Beware that Installation guy may make some charge and ask to pay however fight back  escalate  talk to their Manager or ask for official bill and you will be good to go as nothing will be charged then Only lack of clarity remains is around the type of Wall Mount used  as in my case   the guy used an generic brand wall Mount bracket and it is not at all clear whether Oneplus has their own branding of Wall Mount   Maybe others can add on    Remote   Remote design and all is pure beauty with minimalistic design however do not know where the issue seems to be with Remote or otherwise as it could be like at times mutilple times pressing could be required especially to Turn On the Tv  Not sure whether its remote lag or otherwise   Maybe Oneplus can fine tune with update Overall Analysis   Recommendation  Tv is definitely highly recommend for people priority and focus is Picture Quality and OS  highly recommended for OTT users like me   Bedroom TV   Best Choice If you have soundbar then do not think otherwise as its the best option from others outhere literally MI TV and All completely fail in comparison to this Got free Echo Dot too   Many complained of not getting as they did not read the offer properly as the speaker needs to be added in cart along with TV inorder for promo to apply automatically TV is not Alexa based and so could not completely reap the benefits of the same with Echo however maybe with update this could be sorted too Also for OTT users like me it should have an option that on Boot up TV starts at Google Launcher page only   Again update can take care of this  A word of advice for all confused buyer s   read my above detailed guide and then take a call Nevertheless  you will not be regretted at all with this TV  OnePlus has definitely delivered its premiumness with this TV for sure and which is highly visible too Will update the reviews if add on or change of facts What more are you looking out for    simply buy this TV Never Settle    
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very nice Tv in this price range from one plus Picture quality is superb   Sound quality is ok ok but better than MI TV sBuilt quality is also goodTv looks premium because of Bezel less design Remote controller is also made of good quality plastic and it is very good looking  hotkeys are provided for Netflix  Prime video  YouTube and Google Assistant Overall it is very good and budget Tv from brand like one plus compared to MI   Realme  VU  Thomsan etc 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  TV boots up automatically and does not allow me to stream any content  no help available from Oneplus as they are only offering feedback and no service repair available by Oneplus in my location  Never expected Oneplus device go haywire and helpless services from them 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Looks Great  Colours are Amazing  However  user Experience is not refined at all for Oneplus standard and even for any other standards for that matter  Will edit the review once OnePlus fixes below issues Below are some of the bugs I observed in the last   days  Needs immediate attention from OP Software Team to protect OP s reputation    Very laggy interface across all apps including home screen  play store  voice assistant  Netflix etc    When the TV is off  power button had to be pressed couple of times before the TV could turn on   When the TV is off  Bluetooth keeps connecting back and disconnecting from TV  Alexa keep saying got connected to Oneplus TV every few mins when used as a external speaker even when TV is off    TV also takes time to register inputs from OP Connect app  No keyboard on OP connect app  After restart again need to open Connect app on TV for OP Connect app on mobile to detect OP TV    Customize Channels on the homescreen keeps getting reset   Even when no input is connected to the TV  the TV boots to one of the inputs  HDMI Channel Scan  instead of home screen    Menu button hardly has any use on home screen and only works when used with external inputs    There is no option to adjust colours sound in realtime with hardware remote  i e while watching media on TV    Alexa app does not recognize the TV even after adding and linking Account in Oneplus TV skillI guess can not be fixed with Software but still want to capture for records  While watching from straight gives great picture quality in the class  viewing angles are pretty bad compared to competition 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Got this tv as a cheap and small entertainment unit for my bedroom  Below are the quick pointers Pros    Overall design is very sleek with almost non existent bezels on three sides  Back mount is available  along with two plastic feets that hold the tv up nice and firmly however you install it  Enough connectivity options incl HDMI arc  optical  spdif and they work as intended    Standard smart remote with Netflix  Prime  YouTube and Google assistant buttons  Please note that you have to pair the remote with the tv for the first time before you can use the Bluetooth mode  search in web     The display is pretty good with excellent color accuracy though there is no HDR Dolby Vision support  However  I have seen the HDR implementation in cheap TVs  and I would rather have overall bright and uniform screen which this tv provides  Minimum backlight bleeding  Slight loss of brightness at high angles of viewing but pq remains same    Sound quality is pretty average  but loud  it is good enough for a       room but at more than     volume  the dialogues become difficult to understand  I have heard the speakers in other sub   k sets and this one is definitely among the top      Inbuilt Android   OS is pretty good  have access to almost all the entertainment apps that work out of the box  there is a bit of lag at times when switching apps and scrolling the menu but it is not too distracting    Works great with Google home and offers full voice control  Inbuilt Chromecast is fast and connects quickly  You can also cast video from laptop using Chrome VLC other cast apps Cons    Only    p though YouTube will go to full hd  Given the price point  it is fair  but a full hd panel would have been worth more to both consumers and company  At close distance  you can see the LEDs but more than  ft  you are game    No  ghz WiFi band support  but that is alright because sub hd content will not need more than     mbps at max  Channel congestion can be a problem if you have too many devices connected to the    ghz band  so keep that in mind    Remote lags a bit post cold startup  Especially in apps like Hotstar  Maybe software update will fix 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Absolute Disaster        Echo Dot was free along with the product  But I got to know that it needs to be added while ordering  But when something is free with order  why it is required to be added  Simply to fool people Very disappointed with Amazon this time  Really really bad    There is a blue flash which appears while the tv is on repeatedly    Sound is the worst you can think of Overall a bad decision  Both Oneplus and Amazon have been disappointing 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worst ever product from OnePlus  Remote not working properly  Whenever I am trying to switch on the tv using the remote it never responds  Even OnePlus care did not provide any solution for this issue  Amazon provided a replacement but the problem still persist  Hence returned 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This is the worst product by oneplus  I ordered this bcoz I am a big fan of Oneplus smartphones and used every smartphone of oneplus so I thought this led will also be amazing  But as I received the product  Speakers were not workingNo WiFi connection was enabled So the guy who visited to Install this  marked as defected Again when I received the replacement  now the display was not working properly  So I returned this  Only the good thing is the delivery by amazon which is very fast  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Tv ordered on  th July  received on  th July  but installation service not done by Amazon till now   they told me and mailed me your TV installation done by  th July between  pm to  pm  but when I received the TV  from delivery person  within   minutes I got a mail from Amazon  your tv installation reschedule on   nd July  I am shocked  then I called to Amazon  what ther told your area restriction for visit  when the ristrication once lifted we Will arrange your Tv installation service  Then I told him before   day you sent a mail to me your installation done by  th July  now I received the tv   suddenly you telling me your tv installation rescheduled on    of July  after that no response from Amazon  I called OnePlus care about that problem   Times also OnePlus told me you can contact to Amazon  we can not do anything from here  Amazon will help you  After that I felt upset  I think no one help after sell  then I decided I will cancel that tv  then I cancelled  So do not buy one plus Tv  Also Tv ratings not good   Overall rating       so please go for VU cinema TV  best tv under          also Samsung  Motorola you can go for these TV s 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  One Plus name say about its premium brand  Echo DotAudio Quality is good enough  Visual are very good  Software not lagged any where Fixed wall mount free of cost Instruction  On st time turning on your Android TV do not  add google account  and location settings instantly  give some time to set up the device  I did not see and lag and hanging issue Later   hour of normal TV usage I tried to setup my google account and later I I updated my system to next version without any single lag tv working smoothly No connectivity issue   Moreover Android tv of Oneplus in   k range with b less display is awesome Echo Dot reached on separate courier the  nd day of my online order     working good and worth for    kI ll again post review after    days 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have Purchased this TV within few minutes of the sale and completely unsatisfied with the product I received  the delivery was on time and had installed  but none of the wireless connectivity is working like wi fi was not getting connected to the TV and could not connect the remote through the Bluetooth feature  The external view looks beautiful  the TV screen view was not that great I want replacement AEAP  Awaiting for your reply 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  TV excellent  but    TV installation very very very bad  not come any call and massage now me open TV
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Google assistant not working complaint    times no solution
Smartdevices,5,CG,     First Impressions    Pretty smooth and on time delivery Easy to configure Impressive OnePlus Connect app Game mode OS Chromecast Bit low at audio part  nothing more can be expected with    W speakers Overall   Supported video formats and features will be updated soon 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  TV responding to remote control is very slow due to   GB of RAM 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Pros    Price   Reputable Brand   Good Sound QualityCons    Over Hyped   Average Picture qualityConclusion What you pay for is what you get  do not make the same mistake I made and fall for the way oneplus markets it 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Maybe because of the high expectations I had  hence my greater disappointment  it is an OK panel at best nothing too mind blowing  System lag is definitely noticeable and the picture is slightly oversaturated But of course this is a budget TV and if you go for more expensive models of Sony  Samsung and LG you will have a better viewing experience  Everything else is fine  SUBPAR at best Save up a little more if you can and go for more premium brands  Taste is subjective and if you are on a budget this would not be the worst option either 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The picture quality and sound quality are good but the problem lies with the remote  The remote becomes non responsive after some time of inactivity and it starts working only after a good      mins  Adding to this  the Oneplus customer support is even poor  I waited for    mins just to get a message stating that no agents are available This was not expected from Oneplus 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   No doubt TV is value for money but has few small issues    It does not gets on with single press of power button on remote    It is a bit slow because of  GB RAM    Sound quality is not a expected Few people mentioned about not receiving free echo dot  I got it for free just you need to add it to cart with TV and at checkout they will give a full discount for echo dot 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Based on a real incident At first remote s down arrow button was not working  I was so not in a good mood  I hit the remote with my hand just like all Indians do    it started working 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Received a damaged tv with led panel visible from outside on edges   amazon technician visited site and informed tv is defective   But amazon rejected REPLACEMENT Saying item is not available and informed me to issue refund for an amount of       For the tv where actually i paid rs        for the order  They said echo dot is FREE with this product when bought together on the first sale  but they adjusted  k to echo dot even they said its for free if bought together  And even after    days and   sales over after that  They are still saying that replacement is not available   Clear case of cheating   I have prebooked the TV before the launch of it only and still amazon is not even taking care of things  And rejecting replacement 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Again good quality product deliver by oneplus   I m using mi tv past   years with lot of lagging while app to launcher switch  This tv has no problem faced still now   Remote working smoothly   Picture quality good  If you switch dolby digital plus  the  Sound quality of tv speakers is good  Also I connect ant sound bar to tv is amazing   not great in mi tv     After update oneplus connect and chromecast working awesome  Tv valuable your money you will not regret    
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Did a mistake of pre ordering it without even waiting for the review    The picture quality is not that great   The interface has too much lags   Audio quality is also not Upto the mark   But has some of the coolest features   Cannot complaint for   k but expected a bit more improved product from oneplus  I mean that is what they are known for   their speed and it certainly lacks in this tv 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Display quality is top notch  Even though it is FHD  And for the sound quality  I also had issue with it  But first go in sound setting and turn on surround sound and dolby sound  And then feel the real sound this TV can provide  Earlier i had an issue with TV not being able to turn on by remote  But after reading the manual i cane to know that to turn on TV it uses IR blaster on remote like old days unlike bluetooth  So you have to point it directly to the right bottom of the TV  A splendid purchase for the price  Really happy  And the display is really punchy and colour accurate 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Writing after a months review Bought this TV as just to test  Amazing powerful small TV      inch with nice picture quality  It does what it says    Most importantly it works amazing with Amazon Prime  Hotstar etc   Many TVs in this segment claim to be smart   but fail to perform  Surprisingly  TV tv is indeed a powerhouse which works without any lag    Amazing work by OnePlus with just  GB RAM Honestly speaking  no TV can offer what this TV is offering in this price range  I have nothing to complain about this TV 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  TV quality is not great at all  The noise disturbance is way too much  Color options are very limited and way too saturated  Also  they did not provide any echo dot even though it was written that it would be offered free of cost along with OnePlus   y   Neither at the time of purchase they mentioned about it  later they added the process   Read everything before making a purchase of this disappointment 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I recently purchased this     tv in amazon flash sale  for   k and got a amazon echo dot along side with the tv  also pre ordering the tv made may to additional   year of warranty  so that was a terrific purchase which intotal made a pretty good deal ProsThe tv built was average Looks great display was crisp picture quality excellent android is smooth for now Sound quality adequate for my use Remote  wifi  Chromecast  bluetooth works fine Cons Low internal storageNo AUX portOverall a deal that can be recommended and will deliver satisfaction 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Wast of money
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Not price worthy  its better to buy   y  than this  There are too many problems  The screen is so laggy and the sound quality is too poor also take time to work for some task and also if you plug in any external drive  it says to fromat 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  HONEST REVIEW AFTER USING FOR   DAYS I received the TV on the date mentioned  inspite of the travel restrictions as my address was listed in a containment zone  Good job by the Amazon delivery in Kollam  Kerala  The product is really worth the money you spend  All features mentioned work  You just have to update it first   Picture quality  is excellent  Chromecast  Screencast  works fine  OnePlus Connect works  you have to follow the instructions in the app   All apps are working fine  Hotstar  YouTube  Amazon Prime  Netflix  You can connect the Echo Dot to this Television and it works perfectly fine  Sound quality  is more than average compared to the negative reviews that have been mentioned  It is more than enough for the television  It will depend vary on the platform you are using to view the videos The Wall Mount was installed by the Service staff and they came at the correct time as agreed OVERALLI am more than happy with the product  I was a bit skeptical about the product after ready all the negative reviews  But I have received a good product and it meets all the specifications mentioned by OnePlus  Great job by OnePlus in coming up with a budget TV 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Tv looks AwesomeBut i suggest You do not buy This    P panel TVGo for Atlest full Hd TV if you canCoz picture Quality is Not so goodAtlest Buy any full hd tv
Smartdevices,5,OR,  REVIEW    The launched was much awaited for   as soon as the sale for   inch was out   we booked the TV  The addition of the Amazon Echo Dot was the Cherry on top of the Cake     The TV arrived the next day in Good Condition OBSERVATIONS   For this price   the TV has an elegant look  The Bezeless Display does indeed live up to its mark  As per my calculations which includes the bottom logo bar as well   the display screen amounts to        of the total display    Image quality is indeed Amazing  The colours are vibrant  Images truly standout when fed with a     p input  The display does pure justice to  K YouTube videos    Audio quality for this price segment yields no complaints  However  You will need a Sound Bar or Home Theater System if You want to enjoy the Video with Bass powered Sound  The TV promises Dolby Audio   but lacks Bass  obviously due to Sound Physics as it does not have a woofer  But still satisfies for a medium sized living room    Inputs are adequate taking into consideration the present technological advancements    HDMI inputs for Your STB   Gaming Console  However a  rd HDMI would have been great to have as spare to connect to a laptop  No really needed though as the TV comes with built in Chromecast for Screen Mirroring    I would rate the OS response      out   as there is some minor lag when using the OS  When I received the TV  I installed the    Mb update  dated   Jun  but I believe there should be another update which should improve the OS Performance and fix some bugs within  A bug being the OS is unable to handle a Non ARC HDMI device well  I enabled the HDMI ARC service not knowing that my STB does not support ARC  Due to this there is a Blue rotating loading Circle constantly turning on my display when on HDMI input  Of course disabling this service gets rid of the Blue Circle  But for OnePlus it would be nice to see a popup stating that the input device does not support ARC rather than have a constant Blue Circle on the Screen   Also  my OS still does not have the Data Saver feature which many users have stated that they do not see on their TV s  So anxiously waiting for the next OTA Update    As many users are raised the issue   Heavy Lag while using Screen Cast Mirroring  Hoping again then the OTA update would fix this    TV Remote functions purely on Bluetooth  The Remote is compact   has a minimalist design  The best part being the remote has   dedicated buttons for OTT apps  Netflix  Prime   YouTube   A drawback I see in the remote is due to it being purely Bluetooth   I no longer can use my Universal Remote for my TV  Also I believe there is a bug in the remote which does not let You switch on the TV instantly  sometimes You have the press the Power button a few times   clearly visible on the red flashing led on the remote  Hoping OTA will fix this issue too  Another issue  my suggestion  with the remote is that it misses the Input Source Button  This missing button makes it extremely difficult for my not so technologically advanced Mother to switch between inputs    Another thing that surprises me is that there is a Dedicated Amazon Prime Video Button on my Remote but NO inbuilt Alexa integration  I have to use a Skill on Alexa but unfortunately like many other people I have not been able to connect my OnePlus TV to my Alexa Account  This makes the supplied Echo Dot     useless as I cannot use the Echo Dot to wake up my TV via voice command  Yet to try Google Assistant  but I want Alexa functioning as my other devices are synced with Alexa  If You are reading this point and have been able to Integrate Your OnePlus TV to your Amazon Account   then Please leave me an Answer on my Question    The last point being   I am not sure if its a design flaw or a shipping mishap   But the TopLeft   TopRight corners seem to be either damaged or poorly finished by the Assembly Team   See Images Overall   this Product has so far satisfied me well  I will certainly be writing another Review when I have the OTA Update to fix some of the Bugs   Add the Missing Features  Until then I will enjoy my OnePlus TV    Lastly    Stars to Amazon for providing the option of  Year Extended Warranty for INR     and automatically adding it to my OnePlus after   days of arrival  In addition  just as promised returing me the INR     back as Amazon Pay Balance  Such offers keep customers like Me Happy 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great picture qualitySuperb Dolby soundNice oxygen app well performedMy family is very happy to see in this tvI have    inch another company tv but colour combinations in this tv is great  we r very happy with one plusDon t FOLLOW bad commentsPlease go with this tvI m using it and give you best REVIEW

Smartdevices,4,OR,  Quite good product for the price  Product is light weight and looks very delicate  Colors are beautiful  Sound system is also great with dolby  But the main problem I found is  the speakers are located at bottom  So if you place if on a table  the sound will not be clear  I am facing the same issue now   but if you are going for wall mount option  then go for it  Neither of the Competitors can give you the best colour viewing experience 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Build quality is superb for this price range  Pic quality is similar to full HD there is no much difference like HD ready  Utube n other online streaming content clarity is good  There is no data saving alert  This can be used as a secondary bedroom TV  Sound is okay  you can connect it with external speakers  Little lag while moving through apps but that is not an big issue  jus give sometime to load  We r dealing with  gb ram and budget processor  Wall mount for this TV is not included  Better you itself buy wall mount stand in local  wall mount cost me    rs for a   k TV  Amazon please set a standard price for installation and let it be visible for us while ordering  Really frustrated by receiving a cheap local made wall mount for    rs from the installater  Initially my wallmount amount was refunded by the technician  now he got it back after a month  The happy purchase of mine is now turned horrible  I reduce all the stars just for installation and the awesome service you have provided  tvse service

Smartdevices,1,CG,  Menu button not working since day one  Volume getting high and low suddenly on its own  Need to watch tv with remote in hand to control sudden change in volume  As per the tv engineer  this issue is with all oneplus TVs and it cannot be resolved  Also  the echo dot device does not work with this TV as of now 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The video and sound quality are awesome  you will truly love it  Dolby sound quality is enough to even for the living room  For DTH opt for a Dolby supported set top box  Software optimization is top notch  Was able to mirror cast  OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update  The viewing angles are great for a VA panel  OnePlus has done a good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P  color gamut and feels of Full HD tv  Google assistant works fine too  The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience  After sales matter and customer service matter a lot in this era  Overall satisfied 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  TV is overall better than others  At this price this is the best  Picture quality is fabulous  Apps work fine  Only it lags a bit  do not use it for gaming  Only  for  viewing  TV 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I feel greatful to get such opportunity to review this product  This is my first time attachment to oneplus and its truely great   Now talk about this product all the features are great and picture quality is mindblowing but there are some disappointment in sound system   it should be better    But at this price range I can not expect more  If you can attach a sound system to this then it will be a remarkable product at this price
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Display quality is excellentsound is okconnectivity with ott apps are little bit slowno screen mirror option only chrome cast but you can do the job with an additional device via hdmi portfinally to say worth for price in this segmentTv installation service become a bit challenge in my area

Smartdevices,5,OR,  Quite satisfied with the product for the price range For people complainting about lag issue  its nothing to do with ram ir storage Just pair the remote with bluetooth  By default remote works with ir which needs a straight line of sight  Once you pair it as bluetooth it works like a charm To pair the remote with bluetooth  just go to setting in tv and click on Remote and Accessories  Adter that click left and home key simultaneously on remote  It will be paired and no lag issue will be there
Smartdevices,5,OR,   First impressions Picture quality is top notch  Bezel less design and worth for money  Sound quality is decent for the price  Product Delivery and installation was on time Will update the usage review after a month 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I thought OnePlus is showing fake bezels on this TV in their advertising material like other brands do but in real also they r thin  TV is perfect 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Loving the picture quality and the thin bezels was not expecting great sound from the reviews but am surprisingly satisfied from the output for my room All the OS features working after the update Oneplus connect was not that useful till now The remote is nice 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Worth buying for   k as you get echo dot free with this the best in class tv for    and in    inch catagory it is the best value for money the package and the built in quality is just OnePlus   Go For It if you are look for the    inch catagory this is a must buy I will use some more days and update some Details 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  after installation of  nd day that black line was on screen its faulty pic
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Sound is too bad and you will literally cry for that    Picture quality is okayish and software is good   Forget about oneplus connect feature    One word review   Oneplus TV Y series  is not good
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Superb smart tv at very affordable price   The best installetion support   update are quick  The best picture  quality and does not require any external soundbar   The apps opens quick and googel assistant is best on remote   Made in india   country of origin also india 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good picture quality  unfortunately returning only due to the presence of some horizontal lines on the screen  Otherwise excellent product for this price 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  First of all you have to change the picture settings and then boom the display is amazing   And the dolby sound is very loud as i thought about  A must buy product  Thanku Amazon for this beauty 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  TV is excellent but for installation called many times and after many calls on  rd time resheduling installation done otherwise   stars from my side
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Picture quality is best with super colorsSound is not upto the mark   tried bass but it is ok for   W also tried surround sound it is ok Checked screen cast  lil bit of delay in it Hope you find this helpful  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Just an awesome TV at this price point  It does has some limitations and lags but at this price point  no complaints it is better than all the other brands available at this price
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Tv is Very nice but Amazon installation service very bad  installation price    And late   days bad installation unpurfasonal engg
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Product is average  plastic material is not good  booting up is fast  applications like Amazon prime do es not work properly sometimes  it is okay for PPL who uses only for dish TV purpose  android version is not up to the mark  Led screen is okay  average product  okay for the price given 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I got    y last Wednesday itself came in good package  no issues with Amazon or OnePlus packages  picture and sound is dope even it connected easily with my LAN and phone 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Best TV at this price available in market no complaints about it every thing is good and fantastic  only thing is you need OnePlus or Apple device to connect to oxygen play but you can also access it on the TV so no issues
Smartdevices,1,OR,  When I purchased this tv there is a offer of eco dot is free with it but they do legal fraud with customers which we can not do any think  Even when I said to customer center for writing complaint but they said we can not write complaint bcz we did not violet terms and conditions it is really bad from Amazon India but about one plus tv picture quality is much better  sound is ok ok over all tv is good with this price range 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Great deal although little bit disappointed for speaker but in this price range its worth itTips  buy prime membership before buying this tv its worth it
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Everything is just Perfect Except Sound quality Bass lovers should buy soundbar to experience this amazing Product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Picture colour blinking after   days disconnect automatically from wifi network
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This product is very good and excellent sound quality  don go with the negative review   this product is just awesomeThe review in youtube and other social media platforms are totally wrong I personally used this tv  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Great picture quality  good sound lacks the bass effect  but Dolby audio enhances the sound   best tv in the price segment  do not think twice  just go for it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Full HD     p video picture good Sometimes remote is not responding well Sound could have been better New app install update  uninstall are very easy Also have Some pre installed app which is not uninstallable Overall good tv  better than Mi 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The TV is good for the price you pay  We things that I would like to suggest bring it to notice   This not yet compatible with Alexa   sound output is average  would recommend a sound bar to enhance sound quality  try Blaunpaunkt SB        Picture quality is good   few backlight bleeds  You will need to set it to correct color setting to have a good viewing experienceRest is good  Hoping Oneplus would give OTA updates to resolve few things
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Picture quality good sound average connectivy
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Add clearly says it is along with Eco dot   worth of        but it is not   there is separate procedure to avail it  if this is a free why one more procedure required   it is eye wash to customer 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent and satisfied with the tv  sound quality was amazing and installation was done after   days  Intially the tv was slow when connected to internet later it was working normally The screen casting also very fast and finally thanks to the installation team for installing the tv before intial scheduled appointment 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The packaging was simple and easy to unpack  As mentioned in the description the packaging includes TV  remote  user manual  warranty included   AAA battery  Wall mount is not included The TV is very slim  light weighted and easy to setup  Display looks good  sound is fine  Operating the tv is easy too 
Smartdevices,5,OR,     product is made in india   Picture quality    super   Sound   super   Connectivity   super   no buffering prime or Netflix or YouTube   Feels like theatre experienceWon t work proper with OnePlus phone to OnePlus tv lags too muchWorth buying          
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Data saver is must needed for TVs when Streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video does not allow you change the streaming quality  it streams by default at FHD     p  consuming around   GB hourly  I stopped watching at all  I thought OnePlus would include Data Saver in their Y series as well but they did not and its their in you and Q series    The TV is Gorgeous in terms of hardware and picture quality  Id say best in class  I hope they will added it in next update  Also the OnePlusConnect app does not work AT ALL  Thanks Oneplus 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Best priceGood pictureGood screenI hate soundsSpeaker not goodTemple speaker thu
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Simple and nice tv with loads of features in small budget happy with the quality and performance   thank you Amazon and one plus for delivering the best beast tv 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  it is disappointing to see that sound was not something one plus put their efforts to improve  fortunately I did not get a laggy TV mine works fine although power on and off with the remote is tricky and build quality is the lowest I expected  there are haps everywhere very low quality body  Have to be very fragile while moving it  although having these problems I do not think I will return the product  But still to play a game with a brand image of one plus  it really did some damage this time  I will not recommend this if you are saving up for an immersive experience it lacks some of the basics of TV requirment 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very cheap in Built quality I am disappointed with OnePlus never expecte this type or of products launch by OnePlus
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Tv is looking great physically and also its interface easy to useOnly one problem i am facing that  is connecting the tv to the settop box through hdmi   port always mute the audio after power on but hdmi   arc port is working fine   Also i cannot control the volume of the tv in the settop box using settop box remote on Dolby mode
Smartdevices,1,OR,  It could not even run for  days and now I am not getting a refund replacement
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The product I received was defective  the installation executive came to my premises and submitted a job sheet to amazon mentioning its defective  The panel did not switch on   I guess I was the most unluckiest person to receive the defective product  expected more of  plus tv   very bad experience initially   hope I get my replacement tv soon  I request amazon to expedite the process  I waited nearly a week to receive the product another couple of days for the installation person to open it and declare it as defective  how long should it take for the replacement and how long for the service person to open the box and install the tv from it is original packing           
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Like this tv very much  Better picture quality  good sound and connection  Floor stand distance is high so could not accommodate in my small TV table  Sometimes prime get restart automatically  Otherwise it is a pakka product 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Nice quality
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent features and working also perfect best tv on budget simply buy it
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome product
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great product at        after card discount  Amazing panel and color depth  Go for it  will not regret
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Everything is just amazing  Only OnePlus connect is useless  But it is ok  When you have normal remote  You really do not need that stupid application  Please go ahead and buy it  You can trust amazon and the installation company to help you during any ups and down  They are really helpful  Installation is free and wallmount is also free  You do not have to pay   rupee also  If you do not ask them to put new switch board or wiring or something  They will come drill   holes and put the mount and will go  Simple and easy 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Thumbs up for timely delivery and installation for Amazon Review after    days Picture quality is good and for the price is great  As got     rs  Echo dot and  years extended warranty

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Amazing
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Expected a lot    but basic things not functioning   The Jio  G connection does not get listed and hence cannot be selected    The connect app does not connect   Though Chromecast is available I have been unable to cast anything   Sound is not smooth
Smartdevices,5,CG,  In this price you can not ask for more Awesome picture quality   a bit slow operating system else everything is good 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  OnePlus tv is best    but amazon courier faciliti is very very bad   I am very irritating for wating this product   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  For this much price we can say TV is good in every aspect  But there is a lagging problem  it is taking time to open any app 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome sounds  connectivity   Picture Quality in this price   love it  Thanks Amazon   OnePlus 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I am one OnePlus fan always  TV in this low bedget is very good  Sound quality need improvement  Picture quality is good and over all value for money 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Wonderful picture quality   Easy to operate but one plus connect app does not work  Volume is not that much  But it is worth it for the price it comes under
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very nice picture and sound quality   sometimes flicker if redmi cable is close but the installation service is very bad
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Value for money
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Price is reasonable  picture quality is good  Connectivity also good  remote is small and good  sound is ok  need to explore more  bazzle is almost negligible   Looks good
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Just AmazingBest in the segmentNo competition with thisGreat Colors and bezel less display 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good in this price
Smartdevices,5,CG,  so far so good   
Smartdevices,4,OR,    week use reviewPros    Picture quality  good  you need to try different mode like for watching movie try Movie mode  for sports use sports mode    Bezel are really very less at this price   truely smart  download one plus connect and use your mobile as a mobile    First update the TV s software  after that no slowness in software  You can cast mobile screen with this amazing software one plus connect    No issues in casting from youtube  Amazon  even Gaana to play songs   Remote is what it should be like  all necessary keys no useless keys ConsSound could be little better but it is still better than my old sony Bravia Rest all is good 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I purchased this only for the brand name  You get a woww factor when you say you have one plus Tv Other than that it is pretty normal TV for this price range  You get cheaper     k  Tv from Thompson  Mi and VU for this price range  So you are actually paying  k for this brand value and nothing else as the specs and performance match with other Tv brands Display quality is very good and sound could have been better  these are on par with other TV on this same price range  Down firing speakers make sound little muffled Casting works perfectly in both android and iPhone  Airtel Xrteam or jio live tv app is not available for any TV models but you can run it on phone and cast it to TV  So you do not have to purchase a DTH or cable with smart TV with built in chromecast TV does become slow when you open multiple apps but this is problem in all budget Tv models   hdmi ports is not a problem at all  As mostly you would only use   ports    for dth and   for playstation  Since moving to OTT we no more use DVD or blue ray players  Also chromecast is inbuilt  so there is really no need for  rd hdmi cable 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome product  superb audio n video really experienced with  k video n dolby audio but Google chrome not installed in this
Smartdevices,5,CG,  OutstandingI love it   Nuch better then MI led
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The most horrible thing about this tv is its remote control   Very much irritating you to press the button     times to change something   not expected this from one plus   Although this tv has a good picture quality   average sound clarity and a decent bezel   less display   It can be said a value for money product   But the remote connectivity and performance is awful 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  I am not too happy with this one  I had huge expectations  Too much of LED bleeding issues and patches across the panel  I am awaiting an inspection from Amazon  So hoping for a replacement soon  Initial overview  price wise a good deal  if my panel issue gets resolved  But if you do not consider the price  this comes nowhere near to a Samsung panel 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Waiting since last   year for    in TV  Finally able to purchase  More value for less money 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Got defective PC  The same has been informed the TV Installer Dead pixel and damaged on bezel do not purchase this

Smartdevices,5,OR,  Value for money     Worth it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  do not believe any false review and go for it  it is the best tv at this price You cannot expect anything more at this price 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nothing better than this in the market in this price range  Buy without any hesitation Like a lot of other people I did not get the echo dot too  so a little sad about that But TV is amazing

Smartdevices,4,CG,  I am really satisfied by   plus Display quality is bestSound enough for a medium sized hallScreen mirroring works without laggingConsGoogle voice search delays by     seconds plus connect is not so much interesting as it is too much slowBluetooth we can not connect our mobile but only tv with headset and Bluetooth speakerSo do not think of connecting mobile BluetoothOverallDisplay is awesomeSound quality niceBass average
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best product at this price
Smartdevices,3,OR,  After using   y  for    monthBought this OnePlus   y  android tv for a very cheap price  but the product is not upto oneplus standards The picture quality is OK  and sometimes it gets flaky and dark for no reasons  Once i fiddle around with the picture settings this issue fixes  but it happens frequently  it is like the tv is unable to remember the picture settings Sound quality is also just about OK  there is like literally no bass  does not matter how many different audio settings you try  the audio is weak  But  you could say   Itna paisa me itna ich milega  Important issues The tv hangs  it just freezes  not very much  but once in every     days  Then you have to restart it from the main switch Many times there is no audio  does not matter which input you try  To fix this I have to restart the tv from the main switch I sometimes connect bluetooth headphones to my tv  To connect it the first time  obviously  pairing is required  But  to connect it the second time  I have to unpair my headphones  and then again pair it  Otherwise the headphones will not connect automatically  And there is no option to search manually for previously connected devices  Every time I have to unpair and then pair the bluetooth device The tv remote hangs too  Not all the times  Mostly it works very smooth  but sometimes it hangs  I think this issue is because sometimes the remote does not get connected to tv via Bluetooth Not to forget the tv does not have a     mm jack You cannot access tv settings while you are using any app  You will have to close the app and go to home screen to change audio video settings  etc Netflix only works in HD quality  there is no FHD support for Netflix  I use  k Netflix subscription  but on this tv it only works in HD The Alexa support is still not available in the tv  I just cannot connect my Amazon Echo device to the tv  Tried everything  every steps i could find on the internet over several forums  At the end a OnePlus official answered my query on one of OnePlus official forums that the Alexa support will be made through an app  which will be released shortly  The app is not released till date Overall  I five     stars to the tv  Just because of price and remote design  there is nothing else special about the tv 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The best in this price segment 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Alright  here is the new One Plus TV   Y  You can watch Unboxing on my you tube channel X Plorer  I have been using this tv since a week now Here are some pros and cons of the tv Pros  Price  yes being a Indian we always seek products which are best quality with affordable price  It fits well  Gift  Yes  you get Alexa Dot with OnePlus   Y and    you TVs  Who do not like free stuff  Picture Quality is super with baseless design of     of total view  Viewing angel will give you great experience  Build Quality  I have been trying different TVs till now including Mi    inch  Iffalcon   inch and other but trust me this One Plus is far ahead when it comes to design and quality material Cons  Sound  Yes it has   wt output sound with Dolby Atmos but you will not feel bass  RAM  It has  GB RAM with internal storage of  GB out of which only around   GB is useful  This would make operation lit slow  Andoid oxygen play  it is hardly has watchable content and it is too old as there is Patch wall 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The TV looks really good with thin bezels 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Everything is perfect  You can go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Amazing picture and sound quality

Smartdevices,1,OR,  Disappointed with Oneplus  purchased Oneplus   inch TV  stopped working within a month   even after complaining several time  there is no response Edit             Screen was replaced after   month of complaint in JanuarySoon after few weeks again the same issue has been started   now i make a complaint let us see when i will get a replacement 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Superb awesome tv must buy it  Go for it  Thnsk  oneplus
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Respected viewer I know before purchasing this expensive leisure you will be viewing the rewievs let me tell you this TV has a great picture quality and smart features but this crashed in just   days of use   I purchased this TV long time back and it was kept in one corner of my house and then after a hell lot of scams one fine day a totally unprofessional fellow came to install it        After damaging the whole wall with innumerable drills he installed it and did not even explain the features which   somehow   we got to know about     then he charged the double price for the wall mount     then after thousands of complaints finally we got a refund  Would suggest to buy from a showroom  Hope you find it helpful but informally would like to tell if you do not want to fall in any sort of problem      Then please do not purchase this product  Have a good day
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Very nice  products  One plus
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome tv
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   it is awesome tv at   k  except for viewing angles it is color production and lookwise it is unmatchable From front on it matches any full HD TV  interface is smooth Color production is really good  blacks are really black like OLED panelFrom sides it is colors fade is noticable  it is the only but big negative from OnePlusWhen it comes to sound it is good while streaming through apps like YouTube  hotstar   with set of box it is bit low No lag in OS  remote is easy to operate and premium look After   months usage   it is going great and really satisfied
Smartdevices,3,OR,  If you are going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast  gb   day data plan dedicated to this TV Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality Let me start with the pros   Picture quality is great  you will need some Tweeks though  Set it on movie preset for day time use  Energy saving for night time use  I reduced backlight to    and it is in user mode to reduce eye strain    Audio quality is good  You also need a lot of Tweeks though Set it in movie preset if you are watching movies  This preset let us you hear all the music details also you will hear the dialogues crystal clear  In this mode you will not hear bass that much  you will get a hint of base nothing much  Because base will affect the Dialogues Set it in music preset if you are listening to music in this preset you will hear all the highs and lows crystal clear  you will get bass as well Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con It has data saver installed but you can not able to access it  Data savers has an update in playstore  For some reason it is not updating You can not use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker  You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen Which brings a lot of problems  First you need a WiFi router with   GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only  Because it is using Chromecast not miracast  So what happens is  you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it is on same network  Which is stupid  Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router  it is on same network for god s sake Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv  so you will end up spending  X data for playing YouTube video    For playing in mobile  for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV   But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only  I do not know any budget TV which supports miracast  if you knew comment below to let me know It can only access hard disc upto  tb Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV you are going to spend more money on ott  let me explain how   if you are going to use Netflix on TV you will need premium subscription to add     devices at a time  Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone  and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv   you are wrong   you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well If you are rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend  gb   day data on TV on regular basis  you will love this TV Otherwise you are going to end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV I chose to purchase this TV because it is an Android TV  also home services during warranty period is free  I do not have to take this TV to the service centre  if there is something is wrong  After warranty period they charge     for the service  Which is cheaper than other brand But if I knew I am going to get this for   k I would not even think about purchasing this TV  Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv  Which lasted   years without any issues 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Perfect as per expectations  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Waiting for the installation  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This was not accepted from OnePlus I bought this     tv on it is first sale Picture Quality   is like LCD tv  not Like LED tv Sound Quality  is not comfortable to ear  Need more concentration to hear sound to understand the words Design  Design is goodRemote  Remote is also goodNeed an update to fix this issue but if it is a LCD tv then no update can fix the picture quality of this tv Hope for the best
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am impressed very reasonable rate and remote control is through blutooth  Killer tv at the       
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Amazing picture qualityDoesn t lag  only lag found was during initial setup   w Speaker with Dolby speakers does a great jobBezels are extremely less and gives a nice experience OnePlus did a great job and does give a premium feel Cons Audio quality should be tweaked  No bass which is a huge disappointment Alexa is not bundled  you need to add it separately during the purchase  Amazon  when you mention that Alexa comes free with this purchase then make it bundled with the TV unit and do not ask Customers to add it separately during the purchase  do not expect the Customers to add it separately during the Flash sale  This is simply cheating on the Customers 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent picture quality  Perfect for a common man s middle class family 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Plz improve courier speed

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very nice
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Overall best Tv
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Worth the money and the quality is splendid 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  it is been    days I am using this TV    honestly the display quality is just amazing and the truly bezel less display looks incredible  However  I am disappointed with the sound quality it is does not sound good  I think becoz the speakers are down facing  but if you have a external speaker  which I have  thn it is not the issue  Another problem is that TV is not that smooth and it lags a lot of times  Hopefully OnePlus will send will fix it with the update  Overall I am happy becoz sound issue is not a big deal as I use a speaker which everyone should  if you want to enjoy movies on prime and Netflix  Lagging issue will b fixed becoz I trust OnePlus  as thr Service is really good  Overall it is not a bad deal seeing the amazing display and stylish looking frame 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Oneplus is worth the money as always 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent Marvelous Exciting
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Super
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I am quite Happy with the product    Weightless TV  Great job by One Plus
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Picture quality is unbelievable
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The TV stopped working after   months  I have registered a complaint about amazon and OnePlus  No one has called or came to me for servicing the product  How come you close the issue by your self this is totally unexpected and unacceptable from your side  It is very shameful on part of you  simply bluffing the customer  Even after repeated complaints to the OnePlus and Amazon  no action has been taken  It is very shameful to both Amazon and OnePlus for their services
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best Quality product at a cheap price
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Had an extremely poor experience with OnePlus TV TV screen turns black on random occasions but frequently  it again turns back on in   sec to   min Sounds stops working similarly Picture turns green randomly This does not feel like a OnePlus product  Even local brands provide better products After all this  i applied for replacement and then amazon scheduled an inspection service and the inspection guy did not show up  Had to rescheduled it two more times but no one shows up  Contacted amazon and told the whole scenario then they replaced it directly Got the replaced product but the issues are still there and this time the product feels like second hand  Only that this time the issues ka worse and more frequent that last one Filed a return request  again got inpection service scheduled and after explaining previous experience to customer care  this time got a call from inspection guy  He made a video of the issue  He said that he has verified the issue but I did not receive any response from Amazon regarding this And the worse thing  Amazon is not providing customer care support now  Tried multiple times but did not recieve any call from Amazon  Feeling stuck with this defective product will not be using Amazon for a long time now Update  After initiating the return order again  Amazon sent people for picking up the defective item  Now waiting for refund initiation 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  do not buy this tv  I am really disappointed  Not worthable 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  good
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Writing this feedback as the TV does not startup using one click on the remote  power button   i have to keep on clicking for many times till it starts up    happens all time I ensured that there is no obstacle between remote and the tvSecondly  i did connect     sound using Bluetooth device  after     days of use i either have to clear cache memory for Bluetooth system or cut off the power completely and restart to use the sound via BluetoothOverall experience of buying this TV was really not good i would say  customer support does not answer your query accurately  showroom guys wants to route to customer care for anything issues I bought an another TV from MI and it has been used since last    yrs I would really recommend everyone to go for MI  no issues till date  instead this one
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The product is worth its price  Let me highlight certain pointspros    Display  the display is brilliant  specially the black color gamut is awesome  Smart features  good smart features easy to download contents  Design  Bezel less design gives an appealing lookcons    Although the product has Dolby Digital surround sound but still it feels a bit low output in terms of voice   The operating remote feels a lag when you switch on the T V    No button features due to which the T V  is solely dependent on the remote and once you get any issues with the remote you are in trouble   Installation  its been a Month since this product was delivered but still installation has not been arranged by amazon  secondly the delivery guy was very rude did not deliver the product at home had to go almost a mile to receive my product  my request to all please ensure your installation else you would be left in oblivion like me 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The TV is an okay ish buy do not come for the Brand here I would happily suggest anyone to go with a Samsung or even Onida TV which does come at a nearby price point The sound is low  but what to expect from a    Watt internal speaker Even though it is back lit with LED  there are certain points where you will not be able to see anything  it will be pitch black  while it should have been normal And for the Game Mode  I used my PS   XBOX ONE and Switch along with that  Played a couple of matches in Battlefield   and WWII  It reduces lag  but not upto a gaming level The remote cannot start the tv all the time It is slow when it comes to remote response  but that is only for the start up But at this price point  what can one expect And  at the time of writing this review  I had a serious issue a few days back  but the inputs from HDMI produced a grayscale output I thought the TV was done for But  it happens across all the OnePlus TV s it seems If anyone has the same issue  reset the entire TV I wasted some time with Amazon and OnePlus Care by scheduling repair services But it was no good All in all  I love One Plus  despite the negative points stated  the above has   stars for Amazon and   for the TV If you want to try this one  gladly you are welcome  but I would suggest you to try another brand  specifically well established ones like Samsung or Sony or TCL or Onida 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I have been using the    inch Y Series for over a week now Pros   love the black tones  the tv itself is very aesthetic  latest Android loaded  all frequently used apps programs available in the tv  the remote is very sleek and is Bluetooth enabled  no need to point remote to tv  the delivery and installation services were very quick and efficient Cons   the OS laga  the build quality does not feel great  plastic body  does not work well with Alexa  sound quality is not great  The colours are not great either  Does not have different picture colour modes  The biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings Overall   for the price of   K     K the TV is totally worth buying  Remember that this is a budget tv  Premium TV s are almost double the cost 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good TV  Superb picture quality  Craaaaazy User interface 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The remote stopped working it is not damaged by any means I do not know now how to use the TV as nothing can work without remote so useless product as expected from China 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is good and worth too
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good for the price you pay  Software is buggy but nothing s deal breaking here Picture Quality  Its Decent  Slim bezels  you will find backlit led bleeding in on the side  Overall it is a good quality  for what you pay Audio  Its hard to hear dialogues in the movies  Ull be needing a decent external speakers for sure 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I installation not done properly   I have registered my complaintSound is not great  buy vu cinema tv for good soundPicture quality is goodUI is goodRemote is good clutter free  simple   cute  After using for one month now there is display issues   I am really not happy with oneplus purchase
Smartdevices,4,OR,     Honest review Let me write one by one      Review after   weeks   First of all I have pre booked Oneplus Y   and availed the ackos   years extended warranty And  also Amazon ECHO DOT along with this TVWhich is worth to buy at   K      Those who have missed Echo Dot  I feel very sorry for them Also Alexa worked me as a smart connector between TV and my Sony home theatre system  without any digital cables or converters     Saved my money there too       Picture Quality   Is pretty good and     i LED display  Viewing angle should be straight and if its more than   degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading  Make sure you are straight infront of TV view    Sound Quality   is ok kind of Quality at this price as I am depending more on home theatre speakers  thus its good for me    Value for money   yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and its      chromecasting is built in  can avail from IOs platform too as I am using it      Includes all the modern smart tv features like Netflix  amazon YouTube and google assistants in one single button  But some time lag can be experienced while changing the input sources Even google assistance is bit slow to catch up when compared to Alexa   Overall I can give     Thanks Team Oneplus and Amazon in
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Purchased it on  th July  Seems to be good  so far 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Impressed with the product quality and design  performance is also decent  video quality is quiet good  audio not up to the expectations  terrible installation service  technician never contacted even after    days from the delivery date  contacted amazon many times  had to reschedule   times  canceled the service at last 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  the picture quality is good compared to other products at this range    there is definitely no premium feel about the user interface or anything coming to sound quality  nothing could be worse than this the sound quality is really very poor  you almost can not hear things clearly any cheap third grade china made bluetooth speaker produces better better sound than this tv why one plus why  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Washed off picture quality as pixel density is less  sound is okay but Dolby features are gimmick Should have been a     p display  No installation wall mount bracket with TV  need to purchase it seperately  it is a made in India product and plastics  sockets and fit n finish is not as good as its Chinese counterparts like MI  VU and others Worst installation service  after    days still no installation  Hence canceled the TV MI TV offers better package for less     Rs  and better build quality 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Smartest smart tv from oneplus  in this price range no other TV s has such picture quality and features  its totally premium product  just one thing pls buy soundbar or any sound system with this  this tv has dolby digital  dolby digital plus  surround sound   which are awesome functions indeed but you can feel these features only if you have external sound system   Else the speakers of   w each are very low in volume  a good movie with sound effects can not be enjoyed at all  else this tv is highly recommended  All the features works perfectly as the company says in ads  Value for money indeed One update after using the tv for     month    Never faced problems like auto restart  lags  etc  But yes if you install loads of apps then you should wait few seconds when you start the tv else you will see lil lags  but after few seconds it will run smoothly  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  By comparing with my friend MI TV  oneplus is very bad  The picture quality and sound quality is very poor comparing with his TV  The remote control and voice recognition is perfect  But the clarity of display is very bad according to MI TV  Till the reviewing date there is no inbuilt apps for screen casting etc  We should seperatly want to download Airscreen app from play store  For installing other apps this TV not have file manager to download apk from USB  we should also want to download that from play store  I am damn sure that My friends MI TV is better than oneplus TV  My rating to this TV is       Not worth this TV for        better go for MI tv or other brands like tcl  realme  etc  I think that Oneplus will overall these products  but in case of TV till I am putting the review MI TV is good by comparing with my friends TV 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Never thought I will have to write a negative feedback for OnePlus products We insisted our parents to buy this TV and we are regretting it The TV constantly hangs and everytime we ask for a return or for replacement of the product  a technician is been appointed to check the TV I really do not know how to sync the timing of technician and the time when TV hangs to be at the same time   Really disappointed by the product and also by Amazon because I still do not have any clarity whether or not there is going to be replacement or refund or not   Requesting Amazon to kindly provide the relevant information and solve the grevieneces of geneiue customers Note I have called Amazon customer service for atleast   timesAwaiting a positive response from Amazon
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I am writing this review after using the tv for more than   monthsPros Picture and sound quality is goodNice and handy remoteCons  Says Alexa supports this product but it only supports volume  turn off tv  change input Hangs once or twice in a day which is very bad  did not expect this from one plus When viewed from side picture becomes more white  Visibility is not good from side angles When try to switch on tv you have to be within one meter for remote to work else tv will not switch on  this is worst
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Biggest disappointment with this TV was that this TV does not support  ghz wifi bandwidth  it still supports the    ghz  Which I realised after everything was setup Overall the TV is good  picture quality is good not great but assuming the TV is for only Rs        I was not expecting much Sound again is not top notch but loud enough  You will have to customise the sound settings a bit or if you really want that sround sound kind of effect you may need to buy an additional sound bar The remote connection is good  and everything else is fine 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  From Starting Day Of Purchase I am getting Issue    With TV but Nothing Happened    Neither did solve with Amazon customer care nor with Onplus customer care     Still I am Helpess worst TV Ever    Scene From starting day    Issue is coming Displayed Showing Black And White     USB Does not supporting     Any Pendrive     Any app if opening it is taking   second To Open    So much of Lagging Issue    From starting day    The    Bit    It not look it is supporting at all      GB of ram Is still low      I guess   Amazon Told Again Happened they will replaced the TV But After    days Policy   They assured that After Third Technical Support My Policy was Going    They said do not worry    You Will get replacement If This Happened again    Now All issue I am facing Neither Amazon can not do    Or Not One Plus Service    Is Doing   Amazon Worst ever      Mr  Jeff Bezos      Amit Agarwal 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This TV at that Price Tag is really a competitor to many other brands The Best points from this TV include  Smart Features  Minimal Bezel frame picture  Google Voice Assistant  Customer friendly settingsOne thing I was not accepting from this is its sound  I used a Samsung Smart TV before this and its output itself sounded as if it was from a home theatre but the same output from Oneplus was pathetic  I even tried all their settings and features available  I then ordered a JBL Infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over Bluetooth  It was then beautiful and perfect  But after a couple of days there was a lag between the TV sound output and that from the Home theatre  I then replaced the JBL thing from Amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days I am still worried if the Bluetooth feature of Oneplus TV has an issue or just my specific piece  This review of mine does not judge Oneplus TV at any side  it is just my experience  Other than the Bluetooth lag at some times  everything is at it is best and you can go for it without a second thought 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I got this tv on    August and installation was done on    August  After using for   day i noticed some problem in the display  There were some black and white spots on the screen when the screen comes to white colour  In my opinion this tv is worst ever  Sound quality is also poor and picture quality is ok   overall my experience is not good and i will not recommend to buy this OnePlus TV 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I gave a   star for sound bcz it is good compared to other   K systemsThe Dolby will work like a charm when you get a proper Dolby supporting speaker or soundbarMy suggestion    get a good Speaker system with surround sound     and your home theatre system would be complete with this TVNo installation provided by Amazon     got it installed myself after waiting for installation team    for over   days    I was told a call back will be arranged     but not even received one to say sorry    we will not be able to Install the product
Smartdevices,3,OR,  this TV has some serious software issue  until or unless they rectify the issue i would not recommend this TV  but yah i hope it can be resolved by a software update  takes time more than   month i guess  Software issues    when unboxed it was fine after some days  the software is getting lag     the screen is getting Fully RED sometimes  like the display has damaged   but after restart or re set the TV  it is  getting normalized   Picture Quality is not too awesome but yah if you could adjust the Picture settings its nice but not awesome Good aspects    the Remote is awesome   if you connect it with bluetooth its damn good  if it is not its bit laggy    if you are watching the cable dish  you do not need to change the input always  to HDMI composite  it will read  the last input when you switch back on    oneplus connect is working fine   but yah its laggy  you can change the below steps   movements  left right up down and select    change the inputs  hdmi composite      back button   google voice is working fine  can open the apps    download   etc       the TV sound is great not a dolby one but yah its good Bad aspects     not able to connect with Alexa Echo Dot  rd gen  i have checked with the service team they told its might be a  software issue  and they also told they will sent a guy to resolve this   technichal guy is not yet came    some time the screen is getting Fully Red  got resolved after re setting   its irritating sometimes to re set the  TV again and again    while purchasing the TV  the Alexa Echo dot  rd gen its not free  i have checked with the Amazon  they told its  not free anymore    wall mount is not with the TV  we have to purchase it from the Amazon technical guy and cost is around          better to purchase it separately    there is   aspects to start TV    when unplugged and re plug it its taking  around    sec to completely start the TV   plugged and switch off from remote and switch on from the remote again  its taking around    secconclusion will not recommend to purchase now  might be after resolving it by an software update  might be take some month i guess after   months of usage   TV is getting stuck sometimes  need to unplug and replug to start working again  sometimes composite mode is not working  only shows blue background for    sec and comes back to home page 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The TV display dint start after using   weeks no idea to the service agent what the problem is  Service agent says you will have issue resolved in a week  mail by digicare comes saying issue not in scope of warranty What is the problem   Just    days and this is the condition of tv  regretting myself buying it on first sale should have gone for mi or samsungPlease look into this Amazon and OnePlus  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Review after a week Pros    Less Bezel  not Bezel less    Screen quality is okay for the price range Cons    Muffled audio  No bass  Not even B of Bass    Software glitches  Remote response time is slow    Color reproduction not accurate    No IR for remote    Cheap material A mediocre at best product from OnePlus 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Writing this review after   days of usage  Picture quality was excellent for the priceSound was decent do not expect more  better to go with a     home theatreSome lags in software hope these will be resolved soon by ota updateNice design and bezelless display is top notchInternet and dth connectivity is goodOne con is that it donot have    mm jack i bought optical converter separatelyBluetooth remote was sleek and niceDont bother fake reviews and just go for itGood product from oneplus       Loved it
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The output of video quality is really good But  the TV lags very oftenly Major manufacturing problem in all y series   inch television is with HDMI port    The screen keeps flickering or goes blank for    seconds if connected to HDMI   Tried with different devices in HDMI  port to confirm the issue I got the TV replaced  But the same error again persists even with the replacement TV Hence  it is confirmed that there is some manufacturing deffect with this model of television 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  it is a good tv at this price  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I think that I should have bought Mi  X instead of this but the   inch of Mi  X was not available on Amazon and I do not like to buy from Flipkart    This OnePlus TV has lot of lag issues  since it has only  gb of ram the optimization is poor   the sound is not good at all  for a room it is okay but after     volume  do not know if volume even increases  instead the effect increases which compromises the quality of sound  I recommend buying a soundbar   does not power on by single click from remote  Some issue with that   does not have new features like multicast Only buy it if you are a OnePlus fan  otherwise Go for Mi  X instead  that provides  K and better optimized performance
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Bad product  no alexa support and aweful customer service 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Stay away from this TV  This is worst thing you can buy with your money  Everything is pathetic about this tv except may be display  which is average at best  The remote is so slow  the inbuilt Chromecast never works  the WIFI connectivity is of the lowest grade among all devices Worst of all they market it like  it is the best thing in the world  Please save yourselves and do not fall for the trap 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Giving review after   month of usage  One of the worst TV s I have ever seen  Avg display  Avg sound  does not switch on as soon as I power on from the remote  need to press at least     times to switch on TV   there is a lot of lag for volume buttons  Sometimes TV itself goes to home page from live TV and does not go back to live TV  need to switch off TV and switch it on again  After   month of usage TV hanged up a few times  The TV even does not connect to OnePlus connect app  Need to find TV on mobileapp for so much time  sometimes even after many trails I can not connect to my TV  Even opening and closing apps is very laaagggggyyyyy 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Lags a lot  Sony home theatre connected to the TV worked fine for the first month but post some software update started to face too many issues  home theatre not getting recognised  remote issue the one plus customer service is very bad they take weeks to respond  They are yet to come and check what the issue is Bought the TV on the first day it was launched but regrett now very upsetting experience 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have bought     version of this series TV  There was network connection issue  while I troubleshoot found that date and time was set as  Sep     every time we switch ON the TV  Because of this internet connection through our wifi router is not connected even though other devices get connected with same wifi network  When I do the warranty claim  after three or four visits  either Oneplus or authorized service personal Amazon itself  cannot find the solution  So every time we switch ON TV we need to set date and time for proper internet connectivity  Otherwise it will work like a normal LED TV only not smart TV  You cannot use any app installed or you cannot install any new apps  Think before buying this TV as this involves big risk  I am writing this review after using the TV for last one month  No response for replacement from either side 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst product ans worst installation  Waiting for installation from the last two weeks  Everytime installation was cancelled due to non availability of stand 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Reviewing after using the product for a month  Picture quality is awesome  It will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event  Sound Quality is average  But you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output  But compared to Motorola and realme tv in this price range  it will lose  In this TV to get a good sound output  you have to max the volume  Software is the point where I got disappointed from one plus  I expected many things because it is a TV from Oneplus  The TV lags a little bit  Control from the TV remote takes     seconds for the TV to operate  I hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem  Ram is  gb and the storage is  gb out of which the available is    gb  Motorola has    gb of free space  So a little disappointment but it is a TV after all not a smartphone   Input ports works fine and you will not get a    mm port  Opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating  As said about the Oneplus connect app  it is not that hype what you saw during the launch event  One annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the TV and then you can use it from your smartphone  Typing option is not available   Sometimes the TV does not open YouTube  Have to restart the TV and then open YouTube If Oneplus is seeing this Review I expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotOne more thing I could not connect Alexa to this TV Also I could not connect Google remote Overall it is a good budget TV  But it is not that buttery smooth  If the software issue is solved then this TV will be a great budget TV I hope my review helps you 
Smartdevices,1,OR,     Screen Flickering is the most common problem   Half of the times  TV does not start with a single button press by the remote    Booting takes at least    seconds   Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time    System lag is the maximum in this class of TV s    Most of the Apps does not work which is downloaded from playstore    Youtube Apps crashes many times    Airtel Extreme does not work   Picture quality does not beyond     p  even if play the  K video Overall the bad experience which is never expected from the brand like OnePlus 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I think this is great Android TV  I got this         It is definitely worth the money  I am reviewing this product after using it for    days  One thing that really annoyed me is that I got this for       and a week after the price dropped to        I know it is not a big deal but      rupees is a big amount and I could have saved it I will mention some pros and cons of product below and this might help you to make up your mind before you decide to purchase the product Positive points    Picture Quality   The picture quality is superb at this price range   It looks great  the colours are very bright and the contrast ratio of TV is also very good  The viewing angles on TV are also nice  I have uploaded a video regarding it  you can check it out    Smart cum Android TV   This is not just a Smart TV but it is an Android TV  This means you can install and sideload any apps you like as per your liking  I sideloaded a couple of apps and they all worked in first attempt  Earlier I was looking to go for Samsung and LG but both those TV in this price range only offers smart TV features and you can not side load apps in a Smart TV  that is why Android TV is best    Attractive Looks   One of the main reason why I bought One plus TV was because of the reason how good it looks  It almost looks like a bezel less display because the bezels on TV are super thin and sleek  The TV surely looks very attractive and it this price range you will not find many TV s as good looking as this    Operating system   The OS provided by one plus along with this TV is very smooth and it looks very clean and runs smooth most of the times  You might notice a little bit of lag while opening heavy application but it is hardly noticeable  In this price you can not really ask for much as TV only comes with  GB of ram and despite that TV runs pretty smooth    Connectivity   Connectivity is smooth and fluid  I connected my Xbox controller to play some games via Steamlink and my Bluetooth controller was detected as soon I plugged it in  WiFi also connects within   seconds of booting the TV  The boot time of TV is also decent enough and only takes       seconds for TV to boot Negative Points    Sound   The sound quality of the TV is fine  It is nothing special and not bad either  The sound quality is little above average  I think it could have been a little better    Price   Price drop pissed me off   I mean come on I paid      extra and one week later the price dropped  that is unfair  The TV is worth at   k too but it could have been a classic deal if I got this at   k     Mirror Cast   Mirror casting from phone has a lot of delay even though I have a very fast network All in all this TV is really good and I loved it Important Info   You will be charged     rupees at time of installation of TV if you want to get the TV mounted on wall  The installation will be done at time of delivery and will be done by same people who deliver the TV  The delivery person will call you and inform you regarding the same  For    inches they will charge     and for above    inches you will be charged      My installation went very smooth and at first TV was not mounted properly so I requested person to put that in perfect position and he gladly did that for me  Overall I am satisfied with both the product and installation 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The TV has similar features when compared with Realme TV or MI TV   If anyone is in confusion you can select either of it Picture and Sound Quality is worth for the price  Smart features are good  Installation and setup does not take much time There are few issues that I want to address    After   week usage TV is shown minor lag in its working    Oxygen play is not as intuitive as MI TVs Interface    Even today I am unable to use Chromecast  I do not know what is the issue    Batteries for remote not provided in the box although it is mentioned But one cannot expect much in        So for the price it is still worth 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am happy with the tv  picture quality  sound quality and all the apps are great  if your getting this for someone who can not use smart features do not worry you can set default input on power on  and automatic power on when connected hdmi device is switched on there are few things to note   you can not log in with your one plus account   too much lag in screen mirroring  OnePlus connect   screen mirroring is working only with OnePlus smart phone Screen cast work with all smart phones    do not Get confused with the   k tv   this one is not extremely slim  thickness is same as any TV you can get below   k 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The product itself is great value for money for less than   k for a    inch Android LED TV  Overall picture quality is great at normal viewing angles but the colours shift slightly at extreme wide viewing angles  But it will be good enough in most situations There are lot of picture and sound settings  it also supports Dolby  You can easily connect your Bluetooth headset or soundbar  Sound quality lacks bass and punch  it is not great for movies or songs  but enough for usual News and Sports  For movies I suggest to use dedicated soundbar or home theatre  Remote control has only Bluetooth functionality  No infrared  so battery drain might be faster  Sometimes TV lags to recognize remote operation TV stand is plastic and feels kind of weak  It wobbles a bit when you nudge the screen  There is no AUX output  Only optical for audio out  Apparently HDMI ARC is there  But have not tried it WiFi connectivity is good and fast  though it connects only to    GHz bands  TV has only  GB RAM so it tends to lag a bit while running more than   apps in background  But it is acceptable in normal circumstances  There seems to be no surge protection so better to connect it to a stabilizer if your electricity fluctuates often USB pen drives can be connected and we can also choose different audio languages in the movie files if available  which is great it is a great TV for the price  More worth than Sony or LG which are well above   k for Android models of same size  I think it has a better display than MI TV  Panasonic or Realme TV 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  TV works fine  Features are also impressive  But the rigidity of the TV is questionable Installation Service by One Plus was very poor  The installation was scheduled between    pm and they reached around     pm and left around     pm  The Fixed wall mount used was in rusted condition  And they drilled total   holes on the TV Mounting board for   screw   and the Wooden board got damaged  The TV was tilted to one side after installation and then they had to use small paper pieces to level the TV   For the fixed TV mount the charge was rs     even though the charge written in amazon is rs     for a     TV  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Its been over   months since I have purchased the TV  As always Amazon Delivery was Fantastic  After   months use I can say that TV is Ok but not great  Picture quality is normal compared to my    year old Sony Bravia HD TV  which is still going strong   Sound out put is good  Smart features are like any other android TV  but the response is pretty slow  TV has only   HDMI ports of which one is ARC HDMI to which my Sound bar is attached  The other HDMI has to be used with HD Settop box Amazon Firestick Connecting laptop   all of which are tedious to change  Facing issue with Amazon Fire Stick on this TV  Fires Stick works good most of this time but the TV can connect sound bar with Fire TV content and the screen goes blank from time to time with many audio issues  Over all I will give it     rating 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it is been only   days that I have been using it  but my initial reviews about this TV is fairly positive  The picture quality is very good  viewing angles could have been better  But the colour and full HD output is excellent  The sound quality is pretty average considering it is powered by dolby audio  The system lags a little but that can be excused considering the price  Overall this TV is catch and if you are on budget  this can be a go to option I will update the review after thoroughly using this TV 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  I returned the product as soon as i bought it  I considered this TV just for the brand value and trust i had on OnePlus since i own a oneplus phone  But OnePlus disappointed me Pros    Cost   Picture quality for this cost     p    Android osCons    Sound quality  not good enough  Even      volume sounds like a      Watching the same content on a OnePlus   was louder    Display looked flimsy and was not firmly attached to the frame 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros    Picture quality is mind blowing for this price as its justify the FHD quality   Smart features works absolutely fine like butter   Voice recognition is very responsive and useful feature as it helps to save time Cons    Sound quality  I will rate   out of   for the sound quality    must need to buy additional sound bar as the sound is completely flat no bass or punch where other brands provide in their inbuilt speakers    Start up time is too lagy where it takes approx       secs  for the initial start up everytime you switch on the TV Overall review If you want a crystal clear TV just for viewing for a price range less then   k then it will be a good choice but need to sacrifice with the sound where spending little bit more of  k   k you can get an overall package with Samsung Lg 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worrest product and worrest service do not buy it is a one plus tv but local quality and not manufacturer one plus manufacturer in hyderabad local company and assembled and I bought July    and worked    days after apps not installed and not updated after tv screen black so i am complaint to amazon they till resolved my issue till date and there is no one plus customer care service centers and very difficult contact one plus customer care and they not respond one plus tv service done by amazon service persons only tgis is not brand so do not buy waste of money and time  Take brand tv and good service available very bad experience in this tv i have faced amazon people also very irregular service with in two months i have two major issues in tv ine is mother board and tv screen tq please check every one mafacture details in tv box shocked    tq
Smartdevices,2,OR,  i have done lot of research before purchase on the  basis of review and Youtube videos but does not helped in making any derision   rather i was confused between all Chinese brand  then made a purchase for Rs         including     HDFC card discount   watched     HD videos with      PMy Opinion is belowBuy this TV if your budget is strictly constraint to       k   you do not bother about Picture Quality  do not buy if you are used to watch Samsung   Sony TV   Full HD videos in mobile or have a full HD monitor  its quality does not matches Samsung Smart TV that is available for Rs        Returned TV back to amazon   now looking to buy a Samsung one  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Screen casting not working
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Poor sound and lags too much
Smartdevices,5,OR,  If you are looking for budget tv go for it   regarding sound issueif you use hdmi cable you will get Dolby Atmos audio which is very low as sound will be disturbed evenly with surrounding  but if you use the old regular analogue   pin adapter probes     coloroued pins for sound video used for DVD players   you will get better loud sound so goodenough  The conclusion is if you want huge sounds go for probes you will get so high volume even when you put tv output volume to   or   but if you want Dolby clarity sound but less volume output go for hdmi cable it will be clear but low
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have contacted Amazon multiple times and every time I get the same answer  there is no stock for replacement  I am clueless about what should be my next step Extremely BAD after sales services  worst Better to get a TV from local store than such products 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Low quality product  bought in first sale  Sound quality is so poor  Returned after few days 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This has been one hell of a let down   it is not a bad TV but something about it that leaves me disappointed  I have had many TVs  Sony  LG  Mi  Vu   they have all add something to vow  This one comes out as very ordinary  But if you are burying it  its not the TV that will bother you   its the service  Its been   weeks since I raised a complaint  they have done nothing about it  Tweeting  calling  mailing   nothing has worked   So my advise   look for someone who respects your business 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Just today the installation guy came and install the tv perfectly st glanaceThis is almost an bezel less tv I cannot expect much in this price but the design is quite stylishSecondly it took some time for start at first timeBut then after it is smooth  nd galanceAfter completed all the setups on tv for its specs  gb ram it is super smooth no doubt there is an delay of   to   seconds but that ok as tv used frequently then that delays also minimises rd glanaceThe sound is grt for this price point  it is not that you purchase a tv under   k and ten compared it with   k tv that is unfair but the tv comes with Dolby atoms   and Dolby Atmos both features for sound th finaleLastly Google assistant works pretty well with this tv too it response time is in milliseconds
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The Product came faulty out of the box  Within two months of purchase there were visible lines and blacked out picture when connected to a set top box So finally one day the product decided to quit with no picture but just RGB lines on display  See for the details in shared pic Now coming to the service part  it is been almost  months since I am trying to get it serviced or repaired by Amazon product support agency   Well it is a new year now still no luck The customer care executives are a bunch of fools with no remors of your problem  Their constant jab is wait for   hrs problem will be resolved  They provide you with all sorts of misinformation regarding their product support  One told me it will be fulfilled by ONEPLUS Honestly oneplus do not give a flying duck  about customer or later in product support  With multiple calls and false promises  I called back Amazon Cs  this is when I came to know the product and service will be done by Amazon  Anyway after multiple calls and escalations till date no one visited  An engineer was scheduled to visit while he did not and contacted me via call and asked me to click picture of the problem and send me via whatsapp  After looking upon it he told me it is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced at the earliest  Well later received a mail from Amazon stating support has been cancelled So the moral of the story is THE STRUGGLE IS REAL Purchase One plus at your own risk do not trust Amazon for any service related query 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Picture quality   AmazingRemote control   Very soft speedy oprationSound quality   Quite dispointed but not bad for    inches tv Overall oneplus is best as other comparative I am used oneplus mobile from last   years Only amezon service was very bad not customer supportive 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Picture quality is bad may be some defect
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Review after using it for   week  Bengaluru Delivery was done as promised  installation was scheduled for a later date but was done as promised  I did not use a wall mounted installation so had no issues with that  Installation was smooth  technician was helpful  Would have charged around Rs     for wall mounted installation    Picture quality  normal  nothing great   bezel less display is the good    Sound quality   As written by other reviewers it is not up to expectation  but I guess that is what we can expect from this price range  Using external speakers will solve it    Alexa control   Apparently this looks like a false promise  Oneplus TV does not get discovered by Alex no matter what  Even customer support team could not help  But saw in the forums that Devs are working on it  Hope they fix it    Remote   I did not have to use power button multiple times to turn on the TV as I have seen in the reviews  Maybe just try waiting a few seconds after you press it for the TV to turn on  Sometimes there is a lag in the remote commands but its not considerable    Oneplus connect    seems like half baked  TV does not get detected most of the time  App crashes frequently  Remote interface is great  but it is not usable  There is considerable delay in remote commands and TV response which makes it unusable    Cast   Screen cast is extremely laggy  but did not face any issues with Youtube or other apps cast    Bluetooth pairing with accessories   I am using a Bluetooth speaker  Initially I had to pair the speaker manually every time I turn the TV on  But after I reset the TV  the speaker gets connected automatically even though there is a missing once in a while    Voice commands   type   There is a lag in using google assistant  but give it some time after you press the button  Voice tying works fine in YouTube and other apps Some suggestions for those who are facing issues  There will not be a Oneplus account login option after reset   Login to Google account  download Oneplus shared album app from playstore   login  Oneplus connect not detecting TV   open connect server app in the TV when you are trying to detect TV in connect app  Not able to use Type sync   Got to TV settings Device preferences Keyboard Manage Keyboards Enable connect server   Once done  go to current keyboard and and select ConnectServer  This should solve it   If facing other issues try resetting the TV and that should solve most of it Hope this was helpful 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I bought OnePlus    Y series smart TV on    Sep      and during the initial usage I felt like this was the best grab for the price because Oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first   months Literally everything was good  But after two months of usage the TV suddenly started showing display issues   such as change in colour   flickering etc and this issue disappears when the TV is  RESTARTED   Again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted So when this happened multiple times I myself recorded a video and pictures  of the same and contacted amazon for the service Believe me this is where it all started to become worser  The technician visited my home and confirmed it that the TV is having manufacturing defect as it does not have any physical damage From then it almost took   months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue  The issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved  I talked with superior associate still they also could not solve my issue  at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level   they had to accept the return as an exception OnePlus brand did not meet the expectations in its TV 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   This TV is not great or not worst I liked the picture quality in this range and bezel less view is awesome  attached picture However  not having aux support is minus  Sound quality of TV is poor  Poor and loud sound does not help And recently I have found a dead pixel on the screen  of which I have attached the picture  Technician came and checked it  Received an update saying waiting for warranty part  Will update how everything went once anything is done Updating on              Received replacement part   Received part was replaced to TV with original one   Executive messed it up and TV is not showing true colors now  To say it is showing negative like colors   Looking trust on amazon day by day   Chatted with agent called Seizel who is stubborn and not at all listening    Rescheduled a service appointment    Will see what will happen and update here Will not recommend this product strongly  Overall so so experience 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  bought this tv in Sept   in the first week only it started saying connected but no internet  at first i thought some network issues  but later figured out all other devices were working fine only this TV has the problem  that time i placed for a service request also that guy came and reset the whole TV and it became alright   i thought some small glitch after that a few days later it again happend and i reset and added all the apps again   this kept on happening till date and abt   days the service incharge came an checked  as soon as he saw he said its a problem with the board and he will raise a request for replacement for the board in   working days and slipped away   i waited  and after a few days called him n he is washing his hands away saying he cannot do much abt it and will have to check with Amazon    the great Amazon has escaleted the issue   times n till date nothing has happend   amazonIndia ur cheats   today i m trying to call and my call is only getting sent from pillar to post  people oneplus  the great chinese and great amazon are trying to fool people   do not trust this TV or any other devices they only now how to cheat people and take people for a ride    never ever will buy anything from Amazon  worst customer care   shut shop and go
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this TV in pre booking  The TV quality is adequate  there is nothing good about it After   months my TV face an issue where HDMI ports were non functional  it has been    days yet  I complained both Amazon and OnePlus for the warranty but both are unable to repair it because of scarcity of parts OnePlus is not the same brand it used to be  the products are pathetic and sub standard 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have purchased this TV in August      and after just one month of purchasing its display suddenly stopped working  When I made complaint in amazon because product is in warranty period so zero services provided from Amazon s side as well as one plus now its been more than   months and none of the technician came at my place  For this thing when I escalated issues even on Twitter as well amazon said contact the one plus directly we can not help  So  till now Nothing is done in this case and after August they will say product is not in Warranty period  So  guys  I now i will not buy any of the one plus product and recommend the same to you as well  This is my story which I thought to share with you if in case you are planning to buy any of the one plus product
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Very good picture quality enjoying watching movies  Sound quality require some improvement  Easy to connect with app  Very good installation service Lots of one start in review are due to not getting Alexa offer and faulty products and installation service Regarding Alexa they mentioned it is free or on less price but as there routine offer it is not kept easily available you have to check and add offer in you r cart which is not expected from amazon  It heart s if you buy product and not got offered Alexa  So my sincere request to amazon if you are willing to give any offer keep it easy and do not hide it  Else did not give what we are getting in this price One  Tv we are happy Thanks
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I had worst ever than worst experience with oneplus tv    Very low quality build material cheaper    Hanging  restarting problem when you switching between app    Google Assistant not working since I update the Android version     Sound quality is the biggest setback  it sounds like a  rd rate speaker and sound is not balanced  There is no clarity in the sound  you will not be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen    Frame of TV is not durable  it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute    Remote is very slow  It takes time and you have to proper focus infront of tv Bad policy of amazon Technician from oneplus visit to solve but failed  technician from amazon come two time for inspection failed to solve  they are not able to do anythingSo  I will not suggest to purchase oneplus TV a lot of problems 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Poor quality sound full lagging
Smartdevices,1,OR,  User interface is good  Sound quality is poor  Have to use external speakers for clear sound  Better options are available in this price range Edit  After using the TV for   months  I have downgraded my rating form two to one star  Bluetooth connectivity is very poor  You get delayed response  The screen has started bleeding  Already have a bright line on the screen which is spreading with each passing day  Worst TV in this budget  do not buy it  Go for other options 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Total Waste of money  Got the tv in flash sale and in only   month remote control stopped working  Asked for technical support  the Amazon guy came for inspection and found the remote control faulty and told that it will get replaced but did not get any replacement till date   Neither Amazon is responding properly neither one plus is responding  Will suggest buying some other product from a local vendor to get support on an immediate basis 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Really loved the OPtv y seriesHave some lil probs bt thts finee  hope OnePlus will fix this in next update  Everything works fine so farLittle lag bt it is okay it happens in every android TVOnePlus tv is handy with OnePlus mobile phones    But does not support screen cast with Mi phonesAudio n video quality is top notch need to change in settings   Overall best for this price range
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Really had a nice viewing experience  Delivery was delayed a bit  Shipped through Delhivery Courier service Myself installed the TV though the technician is scheduled One plus does not provide any wall mounting brackets TV is light weight Sound quality is superb good Video quality perfect at this price range As I have checked the reviews I saw that some of them have faced remote connectivity is very slow  But I have experienced a very good response with remote control I did not face any Network connectivity issue also I was able to access the internet through mobile hotspot and was able to play      pixel quality videos on youtube While accessing the TV through One Plus connect app both the TV and mobike should be connected to same Wifi network  If we get a call it automatically mute the volume  it is a good option Finally it is very easy to operate as it have original android Without any second thought you can go for it 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Avoid buying this tv  it is seems cheap but so is the performance  I bought this tv one week back and in this one week I have faced the following problems on   tv has hung frozen four times  audio was on but video was completely blanked out once  lag when bluetooth headphone is connected and the audio breaks  replacement cannot be done until service centre guy checks it  service centre person never turns up despite multiple follow ups  Raised the issue with Amazon on   th and still waiting for some service centre person to pick my call and attend to the problemDissapointing
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Considering price  it is a great value for money  Picture quality and sound is just perfect  Best thing is sophisticated remote with only required key options  it is been   days we have used this TV and have not faced and lag ussues or any other issues  So far quite happy with the product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I thought that oneplus name might have a good quality product for TV like mobiles  but they failed  After the purchase of TV with in a month the remote stopped working and when raised a issue with Oneplus customer care they sent a service person and he confirmed me that the remote is faulty and will be replaced with a new one  But after    days of complaint registered still they have not provided a remote  all they do is close the ticket after few days and asked to open a new one for the same complaint They say that they do not have a spare remote and this is the response from ONE PLUS CUSTOMER CARE and they do not know when they might have it      days without remote that too on the early days after the TV lauch They are not good with service all they are good with one time sales  WORST support in the industry 
Smartdevices,4,OR,    Worst delivery  Myself being a prime member got the product after   days Followed up for   days complained multiple time abt product not delivered Multiple calls uffff          could see finger prints on the TV screen just when opened from box   worst thing which i am scared is could see blur screen n lines while setting up the tv itself  Bluetooth remote pairing takes very long time   Screen is very very fragile   sound quality is very poor   Picture quality is good 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  All are good but more lags and buggs   some times picture stoping remort Not working properly   and the OnePlus connect is operating but media option missing in that Soo you can not see ur phone videos directly in phone  please update and clear the buggs
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Writing this review after using the tv over than a month The picture quality is doubtlessly good Sound is average  not good for a big room There are problems with remote control  for eg  sometimes when the volume button is pressed on tv remote  the set top box is responding with recall command Chromecast does slow response Sometimes the tv automatically goes to home page A software updating is inevitable for addressing this problems 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  picture quality is good but Sound quality worst and build quality also not so much good
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This tv takes so much time to get start   since we bought this it is having an issue with start up and sudden switch off issue  But we did not get the replacement  Even the amazon is not helping in this and says we do not have policy for the return of the product  Why it should not be returnable on a day one 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Cast on ScreenDelayed and audio is not syncPicture qualityPixel quality is not upto markArrived after   days of TV Delivered date Poor service from Amazon  they have provided the installation service person out of service mobile number Till the end of alloted time none of them called and best part is they have told to forward this issue to next    hours to solve this issue The Amazon service is totally poor  they have told that service person will provide log sheet and one year warranty time but that has not been provided There was not any wall mount So finally not worthy 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Like the TV overall  Good picture quality and software interface  I would recommend it  However  I feel the following could have been done differently    The sound quality is not all that impressive  The speakers are not loud enough  I am using additional speakers with my TV    The processor used is quite slow  I see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the TV    The setup process was not very smooth  When I first started the TV  I could not install or update apps  I had to reset the TV to get the play store working    I can not find a way to boot the TV to the home screen  It directly boots to the live TV interface  I do not have cable or set top box so this does not make sense to me  If there is a way  I have not been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online    The base of the TV does not feel stable  One has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the TV    it is very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point    if your TV is on the table  This makes it hard to access the ports  We have to move the TV to access the ports and    makes it difficult  The ports should have been placed on the side  Since USB is the port I will be using the most  I got around the problem by purchasing a USB cable that I can access without moving the TV I went for the   in TV instead of the   in one just because I do not have place to keep the larger   in TV  If you have place for the   in TV and if it fits into your budget  I would recommend going for that one  It would have been nice if OnePlus offered a   in TV with all the   in features for a slightly higher price than the current   in TV 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this TV based on my experience with One plus Phone  Contrary to the quality of the phones  the TV quailty has proven to be nightmare for me  On top of that their service is poor  The option to register complaint through Amazon gives no result   st the display was not proper  after complaining they took two months to change the display  The new display lasted only    days and now its completely black screen with few colored lines  Its been    days  I have raised complaint to both Amazon and One plus directly but all in vain  I will not recommended this TV to anyone  I have two more TVs at my home  both Samsung   never faced any such issue  Samsung has the same price and same features  I wish I can replace it for Samsung
Smartdevices,4,OR,  It does have a really good picture quality and the sound is also satisfactory  Voice recognition works well and smart features are good  But there are so many bugs in the software causing Youtube and Prime Video to not work properly  I do not know if it is the CPU or the RAM it is super slow and hangs for like minutes which will only get fixed if we pull the power line  Not having an RCA or    mm output is bad  And most importantly  Alexa never works in the TV  The TV turns off and disconnect from the Wi Fi causing Alexa unable to control it  Plenty of bugs in that sector and seriously disappointed with OnePlus coming up with such a product  But considering the price range  it is good  Still can be improved way better 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Picture quality   good Sound quality  okConnectivity  good  Having problems with oneplus connect app  May be some usage guidelines will help Remote operating  worst  I think this is one of main drawback of this product  We have to point the remote staight into the bottom of the tv other wise remote control os not working  I guess it is do with the ram 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  It is an avg  product  almost or i must say  exactly similar to MI  No way near to the one plus experience Buy MI or one plus Y series  features OS everything is same  Samsung Sony LG users can easily feel the huuuge difference   So far working good but sometime TV do not switch on with single click from remote  OS is slow and quite a lot of apps does not work like voot  Using its chromecast functionality to play shows from non working apps All in all avg  product  Good for temporary use
Smartdevices,3,CG,  it is ok but not as good the sound is not good but picture quality is good and its operating system is bit slow
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I can not connect bloototh tv from my mobile the Google assistant does not work and the application oxygen play one plus connect does not work pls help me otherwise I returned the TV  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Installation team took   days after delivery It is bluetooth remote  but sometimes it will not work  We have to use it as IR remote TV is very slow to operate and apps crashes frequently Connecting mobile remote is a hectic process Even if you change color mode in tv  it will work with default color settings while watching tv through AV port Poor panel quality 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Memory is only   gbBefore finishing installation update for   gb was thereIn chromecast there is a delay in video with audioThere is slight delay in all the time
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I just have a single suggestion  do not go for it  I ignored the reviews while purchasing the product stating there are lot of glitch in the tv software  I thought those glitches would go after the update  But it did not happen  The tv has lot of problems  It started from day   Problems with product    Youtube and other apps crashes all of the sudden    Volume key most of the times does not work    Tv does not respond to the remote almost all the time    Chromecast does not work  Pros    Picture quality is average    Sound quality is good    Tv build up quality is good 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Like the title of my review said  I am going to only list down the factual pros and cons after a day of using the TV elaborately and let you decide for yourself Pros Great picture quality  especially if content is in HD The smart TV features that allows you to pair it with your phone  laptop  bluetooth speakers  bluetooth headphones  etc  are super handy The screen size of     is just perfect for your room unless it is ultra spaciousCons The sound    W is loud enough  but the quality is really poor and one dimensional so you will surely need an external sound system or sowaker The finishing of the product is not the best  One can tell how OnePlus managed to price this at   k when you pay attention to how they have cut corners on the quality  The OnePlus logo on the front is titled  first time I have ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand   there is a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels  and the plastic finishing is not even there is a lag when you are operating the TV  switching between apps  browsing content  and giving Google assistant voice commands      of the time  Hoping OnePlus fixes it with future software updates but so far there is no official word on thatThose are my pros and cons in a nutshell  now the decision is yours
Smartdevices,1,OR,  After    days of usage I see the product works too slow The picture quality is fine  After switching on the TV we can expect the response only after     minutes  That in my opinion a waste to buy  Normal smart or android tv work faster than OnePlus Sound is satisfactory Google voice search does not work could not add OnePlus account to the TV OnePlus connect   using OnePlus mobile as remote  looks like a joke or silly app to use because that does not work and connect well with OnePlus mobile Do not waste time waiting for the sale 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This TV has really  really by the picture quality  The grey uniformity of the screen is really very bad  even worse than a lot of much cheaper TVs   The viewing angles are also the worst I have ever seen in a TV    The sound is very  very bad and I would not recommend this TV to anyone  Despite the Android TV advantage  this TV is much worse compared to TV which cost half of this 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Very worst company and very bad customer support    I have purchased this one plus   y tv on   july   and tv display has gone on    Aug       I have complained and talk to many times to amazon and one plus care they only send technicians for visit   I m writing this review after    days from complaint date and still they are saying that due to unavailable of parts i am not able to repair your tv    they are just making fool to Indian user    pls do not buy and do not suggest to any one    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   do not buy this tv  Very bad experience  Far better MI tv    I have used Airtel DTH for watching tv  when I start tv   in the tv side corner moving option of Netflix you tube etc  Why this option reflecting here while watching tv  there is no any option to remove this    Not pair remote with dth remote   When I start tv   there is no option to  set automatically redirect HDMI option  so normally start my tv  I do not want online content  I want only dth connection tv  you have to always  manually select HDMI    Return option is not available 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Not able to connect with AlexaNot able to connect with OnePlus connect app Google assistant on TV do not understand anything Can anyone help me connecting Alexa and OnePlus connect app with this tv Several emails written to OnePlus support team   but no reply
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The sound quality is not good in this tv  overall its a awsome product by one plus  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Problem in hdmi port    Seems a software problem which led to random loss if signals on the hdmi port    Apparently  this is an issue in multiple sets  Finally the problem was solved after a s w update  But now  any time tv is turned on it automatically switches off and has to be turned on again  Started after the latest software update  Host of other problems as well  Whenever media is played from usb  the tv goes into sleep mode and stops after      minutes  This is despite disabling the sleep timer and other power save options as well  Truly ridiculous product with stupid problems even if you consider the price range  Between this and the phone started to realise OnePlus is just big hype  Products are sub standard 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Product was awesome  Delivery also fast  but pathetic service from Amazon and Cloudtail side  Because they forgot to put user manual and remote for the tv  Screws    a battery  Without remote how can anyone able to operate tv  Pathetic service by Amazon   Cloudtail 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  No doubt Picture quality is really good but this TV has some issues  if You want a true review and complete details regarding cons then go and watch Techiebeez India Review of this TV on YouTube  Best channel for TV Reviews
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have bought One plus Tv as I was very much happy with one plus brand after using the one plus   phone I was badly disappointed with the product  Thanks to amazon as they took the unit return back and refunded the money I want to tell separately about the bad experiences    Picture quality  It was sometime too bright and sometimes too dull  Screen was blue   green sometimes as you see in the attached image    HDMI Port was faulty Sound Quality  quality of the sound was like cheap speakers used in the TV unit Overall Comment  Not up to the expectations  Not recommended to purchase 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  DESIGN bug  Currently version   had been installed in my device  Everytime restart   Power on reset  takes the time to   Jan           PM  Because of this Google products are not working unless I change the time settings manually to current date and time So I strongly recommend to take opinion from other users too Am planning to raise service request on this issue to Amazon 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Excellent value for money product   everything works great  No issues at all till now  Ignore negative reviews  you will not get such a good product in this amount  I will probably buy the    inch as well 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Big big disappointment from Oneplus  today my OnePlus tv installation was done  and after installation people went then after that TV started flickering  and after    sec tv is auto shutting down I complained to Amazon and now they are arranging repairing at my home as the product is under warranty OnePlus tv in India has given its warranty repairing to Amazon and there is no OnePlus repairment center in India I had used OnePlus maximum products and was fan but this TV has broken all the trust by seeing the cheap quality of TV Worst quality from OnePlus 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Bad product  No value for money
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Osm
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst sound quality  plus worst bluetooth  plus worst Chromecast  plus lagging and hanging issue  plus displays scan channel page without any reason 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Wall mount was not provided by technician during installation  since they did not have stock  and now I am asked to pay for wall mount brackets  is not this something that will be provided by technician during installation  For trying to adjust for technician request for handing the wall mounting bracket later  I have to pay extra price  This is not something expected from Amazon 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Picture quality is not good black is like brown and sound quality is very very poor I suggest you do not buy 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Picture quality is good  Look   Feel is good Sound is      TV build quality is goodOnly  GB memory is available out of  GB Oxygen Play is useless Apps take     sec to openSo much lag in TVTake     sec to startApp close automatically because of lack of memoryDidn t expect from OnePlus for such a pover product Go for Realme TV
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The TV s composite input went bad in less than a month of usage  Registered a complaint on the oneplus support site  No response since then  no calls  emails or texts from OnePlus support  The visit date has come and gone and I have tried various methods to contact OnePlus support  email  call  chat  without success The TV quality is below average  there is a grey ghosting when the screen is perfectly black even on the android bootup screen  sound is extremely poor  I can never get rid of a boom in the TV speakers  and the TV does not respond to the remote half the time My advice  Go for a well known brand with better service network  It may cost more  but you will be happier in the long run  If you are on a budget  look for other cheaper brands  OnePlus just does not have the quality assurance or the service network in place for their TVs Update  after I posted the above review I called OnePlus support  I had on hold waiting for a rep for a very long time  close to    minutes I think   but finally got through  The service person guided me through doing a reset of the TV and to my surprise it fixed the composite input issue  I also think the sound has improved a bit  So the software appears to be a little buggy  but the TV is in usable state now 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am using this product for the last   months  over it is goodPicture Quality   Good  can it be betterSound   GoodSmart Feature   Average  voice recognization  and some other features are not working as expected Remote Control   Very Bad  If you like to use a remote you need to be very close to the TV minimum  Ft which is not expected  For a smart tv smart remote is a very important accessory without the remote you can not do anything Build Quality   Average  it is could be better 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL I bought this product in October and the installation date given was   month later  Yet the technician had no mood to install it  Further  the Television worked fine for   months and one fine day its screen display went dark  We thought it was a Tata sky set talk box issue but later the other hdmi slot also went dark    I have been calling amazon every single day to provide a warranty repair    but for the past fifteen days they are not able to arrange a technician to visit us  I am fed up calling and explaining the issue again and again  I am now looking for a refund r else i will be forced to go to the consumer forum 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using this TV for   weeks now and I have only used it with my WiFi connection  Ill be brief in my review    For the amount you are spending  you will not be disappointed    Picture quality is good but at this price point  If you compare with TVs at a higher price point  you will be surely disappointed  Colours are bright but could have been better    Sound quality could certainly have been better  do not try to raise the volume too high or else the sound will break  It is  acceptable if you have a average size room say    x   but anything larger than that and you will feel the inadequacies    There is a certain noticeable lag in operation but nothing you can not live with  And you also get used to it    Again  I will say that the amount which you are spending  it serves the purpose    There are other brand TVs also at similar price but this was the latest model and hence I purchased it    I am satisfied  Giving   stars and I do not think that you can get a   star rating TV in this cost 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Surprised that One plus TV not that good  Sound quality is poor  Rough   No changes like cinema  voice  music  etc modes available as in other brands   Had to put a soundbar to get a decent sound  Do please personally visit a showroom and listen to the TV sound before buying one plus TV 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very bad service provide by Amazon  Tv is fill with lot of issue like Choromecast  startupAmazon is not returning this product once deliver if your product also have faults Poor service by Amazon
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I have purchased   OnePlus tv  tv is good bt   tv is panels problem i will contact OnePlus budgets tv
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am really afraid about purchasing the tv because of the negative reviews I have seenBut after I have bought the product I am so satisfied with it and I must not have bothered negative reviewsThe picture quality is good mines an SD CONNECTION It would be awesome with a HD connectionMany said the sound is bad but I do not see it like that because at     of the sound everyone at my home in any room of the houseYou need the adjust the sound at sound settings for better sound with the Dolby given the sound is fascinatingIt is good budget tvBought it along with AlexaMine is a remote location but got the installation done right the next day after the item has been received
Smartdevices,1,OR,     It does not connect to my     Mbps  g Excitel netwrok  It does not show it in the first place    Sound quality is very poor  No base at all    Picture quality is not great    System is very slow and laggy    It lags a lot when I cast my phone    I can not cast my laptop onto it  Even when I can it lags a lot and takes whole eternity My suggestion would be to not go for this model  Instead buy something else like for eg TCL 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  If you look closely my playstation   Is connected to the tv and this is what it looks like                     HANDS DOWN THE WORST PRODUCT YOU CAN BUY   HDMI keeps switching back to home on it is own  And HATS OFF TO AMAZON INDIA I HAD TO SIT DOWN FOR    MINS FOR JUST TO ASK CUSTOMER SUPPORT TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT  AND THE TECHNICIAN WILL COME AFTER   DAYS THEN IT WILL GO BACK WHICH WILL TAKE   TO   DAYS AND THEN THEY WILL SEND A NEW ONE WHICH WILL TAKE ANOTHER   TO   DAYS SO I AM STUCK WITH A NON WORKING TV FOR NEARLY A WEEK AND I AM NOT SURE IF THE NEW ONE WILL WORK OR NOT  WHILE MY MONEY IS SOMEWHERE IN A BILLIONAIRE S ACCOUNT WHICH IS NOT EVEN ONE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT HE HAS IN HIS ACCOUNT THANK YOU AMAZONTHANK YOU ONE PLUSSO MY OPINION IF YOU SHOULD BUY THIS TV IS TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GIVE IT SOME HOMELESS PEOPLE AT LEAST YOU WILL HAVE DONE A GOOD DEED SORRY ABOUT THE RANT
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Writing this review after a month of use Pros    compare to other tv in this price range sound quality is good  smooth installation after paying installation charges around  k plus including wall mount  picture quality is goodCons    voice recognition is annoying  Bluetooth paring is messy some time you need to unpair and pair again  in case of you r connecting a sound at  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  NO SERVICE AFTER SALEno person comes for service in warranty period  keeping Calling Amazon they just keep on reshedule it every week  you can check the service rating of tvpicture quality   its      max supptred  clarity is there but if you want more go for  k and more moneysound   i do not need my home theatre now in average close bedroom it sounds sufficentconenctivty  from andriod mobile to my laptop  pendirve can play anything hereabout my orderfirst i got tv which was faulted  no installtion guy came from service provider that was shocking form me that too   times they said NO comingamazon support team helped me nicely got my order replaced and installed  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I am writing this review after   days of useI was excited for the one plus tv as I have   OnePlus devices in my home and I am extremely satisfied with all of then  But as soon as the TV got installed I noticed that the App icons in the onelus UI were blur  I could see the pixels distorted   I asked the the installation guy if it was some settings issue  He tried to fix it and said that it is like that onlyI compared it with my other FHD TV  MI  A pro  and there was a major difference   after   days the OS started lagging very much  Startup takes minimum    sec  The voice recognition is very bad  The Chromecast is worse   it lags as hell that you can not even understand a single word   Chromecast keep failing when tried to connect with laptop The OnePlus connect app has a   sec delay  The picture quality is that bad You can see the screen distorting in wallpapers Even after so many defects both Amazon and Oneplus has declined my refund saying that it is a quality issue and no refund would be provided for the same 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I purchased it through Amazon on             on   st i went to my native for    days and returned on  th  the TV was performing good till then  On   th Nov from night   pm there occurred a picture problem and half of the screen went black and other half went pink i am regularly calling oneplus customer care but is yet to get a satisfactory answer If they do not replace my product with a new one   am going to place a consumer case registered against them do not believe in this product  Go for Samsung and LG instead 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  To start with the weight is definitely light hence easy to install on a wall  Good decent picture quality for the money one spends on it  can not expect clarity like expensive one on this  Now the down sides of this android TV    The sound quality is bad  dialogues can not be heard sometimes and you really have to crank up the volume to an irritable level    Remote is definitely not the most responsive of the lot  Each button needs to be pressed couple of times while pointing at the right direction for it to work    Speak function is worst  Absolutely non usableBuy only if you use your television seldomly 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Review after one week  product performance is average    picture quality is good  but over all performce not as MI tv Better go to MI   
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Brand new One plus TVs are having issues with Bluetooth connectivity  I have observed this issue after the return window is over  Else could have returned it  One plus being such a reputed company this is not great on their part  Looks like they are now compromising on the quality to bring the prices down to compete with the like of other Chinese players  Bad experience  I would recommend to go for established brands such as LG  Samsung  Panasonic  etc
Smartdevices,4,OR,  TV is ok for use  do not expect too much from oneplus   I expected a lot more from TV like oneplus phones Pros Good picture quality not bettersoftware is user friendlyconnectivy is fastresponsive remote     st time faced lag  After updated it solved Cons Low soundresponse of voice command is a lit more lagviewing experience is not as good     view get better quality  But in     showing a shadowtv mirroring is difficult
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros    Excellent Picture Quality   Sound Quality is Good   but do not know why many are telling negative about the sound quality     Remote Control is sleek and responsive   Connectivity is goodCons    Very high Picture Brightness   not good for kids     Sometimes Connect mobile app works weird   Lagging   very rare  Over all best television at this price with some issues here and there 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Few functions are not working  Had so much expectation from One plus like brand  Please explore more option before buying yhis TV 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The price for this product is good But the disadvantage in this tv are     Poor remote signal   Unable to connect mobile to tv   Sound Quality   High Lag in SystemNot recommended to buy
Smartdevices,4,OR,  TV seems to be very good for the price after   days  But service from Amazon is pathetic for fitting  They sale TV on exchange  takes away the old tv and delivers new one  Then they keep you waiting full day for TV fitting and when you call the service person  he says he does not have time  Call center says they cam resolve only in    hours  So   days you are left with no tv  We were left with no choice but to fit it ourselves  Will never recommend anyone buy tv and trust Amazon for installation and fitting services 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  OVERALL THE BESTBUT BEING A ONE PLUS USERI HAVE TO TELL THAT THE SIZE OF PRODUCT IS A LITTLE LESS THAN    INCHES AND SPEAKER QUALITY IS GREAT BUT WHILE USING NETFLIX WE HAVE TO INCREASE THE VOLUME ABOVE    
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   It is completely budget tv  Picture quality goodAudio quality poorRemote and voice recognize averageThere is no audio output for old home theatresBuild quality not that greatNo wallmount we need to pay extra    rs while installing  worst wall mount It is not slim tvPathetic installation service
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Connectivity issues  screen mirror lag  sound lag while screen mirroring  app response too slow  remote response slow  I used Thomson and Samsung smart TV    inch while is far better than oneplus 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This is an Android TV in budget  it is total value for money   Not to best as compair with sony  But in this price the product is worth  Sound quality is not so good  but picture quality   smart features are very good 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this TV on    Aug and it gets installed on    august and TV was not connecting to WIFI at the time of installation  I logged a service request for the same and the problem is still not resolved even after   visits of technicians and more than    days Just FYI I live in Delhi not any remote part of India 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  OnePlus is a brand what i know   it gives premium quality product  but in this y series tv of    inches   its not upto the mark    i will rate by its performance       product it good but performance is not upto the mark if i compare to MI   tv as in same segment   infact its performance is comparatively more better than oneplus tv    Issues what i am facing   When you will power on the tv  First it shows blue screen for     seconds  i do not kniw why     Performance is low it tooks overall    second to start completely    While give indication to power on by your remote you will not to know  is it actually on or off because it takes around     second to show response     If you are restless person then this tv is not for you  i recomend personal    but all these software kind of issue  it may be resolved over updated maybe  but for now i do not want to go with this oneplus y series tv   I am not     percent satisfied Or next its your call whether you want to go with this product or not   OnePlus is a good brand but this y series may bring it down 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Display gone within one month  Begging service engineer since a week after raising a request in Oneplus Service portal I know it is service teams negligence but problem is Oneplus is least bothered to resolve customer issues 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Amazon delivery very fast  Received next day but installation is cumbersome  The technician neither called me or came for installation on the scheduled day  When I called him  he will send someone for installation  I am watching the TV on table stand  Only drawback of the product is lag in every step  Picture quality is marvelous but sound quality is not clear and upto the mark  Considering the cost  the product is perfect 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The tv is very good  the picture quality is outstanding for a tv in this price range  The sound is pretty good if you select the right setting but the default audio settings produce terrible sound but you can not expect much more with a tv in this range  I do not think you can find another tv with these qualities in this price range other than the Samsung TVs I guess  But trust me  play a  k video and you will be mind blown by the picture quality and colours even though it is not a  k tv 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Got installed today          Everything seems perfect  Picture quality is good   sound quality is nice   not big but nice   maybe when in summer coolers will run   there can be some problem in hearing   but that I can only confirm in summer     smart features   remote control is also very nice   easy to use   Voice command feature I was still not able to use   as I did not get much time with led   YouTube   prime video are working fine  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Third class TV  Never recommend to buy this one to anybody Atleast     times have to press start button to start the TV  Very irritating   Not sure how log this TV will last  Bad choice product  I thought like one plus mobile  TV quality will also be fine 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  We faced a lot of issue with the TV  Everything related to tv is good but the smart part really is disappointing  We have to wait     minutes before the TV turns on  Google assistant is not responsive most of the time  Not a smooth experience  And just for reference my internet speed is     mbps Will recommend you all buy a normal TV and use amazon firestick instead  Firestick is smarter than the smart TV by one plus 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Remote is not quality one  all cheep publishing stuff is bursted out with cheep product  Picture quality is not so good  it will give uncomfortable view to your eyes in couple of modes  software loading and response worst  did not expect this from OnePlus  but overall just ok product at this price  I hope OnePlus stop doing cheep publicity tricks and solve all issues in coming series of TV s
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Guys   this was by far the best purchase I have made   my wife is a   plus fanatic  so I purchased this thinking  it will not be that good    To my surprise the out put till now has been amazing   there is slowness here and there while updating but that is normal  For this price this TV does not disappoint   Premium look and premium quality
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros  Excellent picture quality  Voice quality is good but needs go to settings and do setup to genre you watching  I set it to sports for everything  I bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price Cons  No bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard  Takes good      minuts to boot up Overall verdict   Satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product  Could use a notification sound to save my remote though Amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation   Also the TV was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after  days  Moreover they void your warranty if you go for DIY installation or setup which is pretty easy to do  Strange from amazon 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Purchase this during Amazon sale for my room and its an excellent TV  Have been using it for more than a month now and there have been not any issues such Pros    Amazing clarity   Amazing sound for a small room   Chrome cast or casting works neatly   All the apps work extremely fine    The Bluetooth remote is extremely good and there is a knack to use this   it gets switched off due to inactivity so if you want to quickly turn on your TV you will have to press on the power on button twice with a gap of   to   seconds in between Cons    There is a lag while starting the TV and some apps    Voice recognition take some time Lags do happen because you are paying not a big price for a TV like this which is feature loaded so I feel this is worth the Buy 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  TV RECEIVED ON OCTOBER        AND PURCHASED   YEARS EXTENDED WARRANTY     BUT did not GET WARRANTY CERTIFICATE YET     LAGGINGGGGGGGGG     SOMETIMES DISCONNECT FROM WIFI    AND RESTARTS AUTOMATICALLY    IT NEVER WORKS WITH ALEXA ECHO INPUT    TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED     
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Never experienced like this from OnePlus Product earlier as i am fan and mad about the brand but this product proved that oneplus is also doing the same gimmicks like others  slowly loosing their never settle tag    worst packaging damaged box  completely wet on wet   TV has a lag will not response to the remote and even crashes and freezes sometime   light bleed from the frame   dark patches on the screen   if your ceiling fan is running  forget about the TV output sound  worst output hard to hear    worst Amazon customer service no technical knowledge and always demand for pictures and disconnect the call Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of         as against   k which I paid for the TV after waiting for   days and even brought pre book deal from Acko and cashback and alexa  customer service simply says product is not available for replacement cancel and take refund of        never thought of writing a negative feedback on Oneplus  brand is loosing its value  I will strongly say Worst product from Oneplus and worst service from Amazon 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   do not buy this TV  Worst experience  Bought it only   months back when it was launched  But now the screen display is flickering and stuttering  The OnePlus service team is so poor that they could not even respond properly  Oneplus may be a good brand for high end mobiles but not for any other consumer goods  I just want some technician to arrive at my place to sort the issue out  No one is responding properly  Service team sets a bad example for OnePlus  Oneplus service team is not like for samsung or any other big brands  Their network is so small that they can not provide the service on time and in many areas 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  After two week  scree problem    how can i fix this
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Review update on           I have contacted customer care several times  and still they have not responded  Amazon customer care just says that they follow up the matter  but still I havnt received any updates regarding they matter  they just do not value people s money these people just want to sell the product n do not want to know elwhat happens after saleI have one plus mobile  so I thought that TV will be having the same quality  The tv is awesome but the service from OnePlus Amazon is worst  Display n all is good but tv do not have any built in quality   the main board of the Tv was damaged within one month of use and till now these Amazon OnePlus people havnt done anything to get it replaced  it is your money so please do not invest in these items were they do not even bother to give a service
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The TV s voice assistant features are almost non functional  Every time when I tried the voice command  the ongoing video movie stuck  The picture and sound quality are not so great for a room of     sqft and there was a lot of glare even with less light in the room  tried all the suggestions on changing contrast brightness etc   By looking at the hype  I expected a lot but this TV did not meet any of my expectations and left a disappointing experience 
Smartdevices,2,CG,  I have purchased    Inch TV   scheduled for Installation come one day late  the person who comes for the installation has no idea regarding the Product even not able to explain how to operate  Product display is good but the sound is horrible   My son commented as the sound is like the dog with fever barks  will see once it uses some months 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I bought this product and it is  month passed  tv accessories seems to have some malfunction  technically we do not know for sure  and technicians does not arrive at location to diagnose the actual reasons for the problem  Digicare reps will not call on your appointments timelines and kill your time and does not show up at location  Instead on various followups some un authorised person calls and make assumptions from the technical issues as per customer feed and they encourage you to buy a new accessories instead of actually checking the problem at the location  My experience with this OnePlus tv has been below average for the kind of picture quality  sound system and BT connection isues and other features are not so fascinating  i suggest fellow customers to buy another chepaer product with best installation and warranty claims but not this kind a item with such marketing strategies 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am a big fan of OnePlus products and I was so happy when they announced the     TV Y series  I pre ordered it on the first day itself  But later I have realised that it was the biggest mistake  The OnePlus trademark of quality does not applicable on the this Y Series  It feels like they have just put OnePlus logo on some cheap quality TV  I am getting regular issues with the TV  If I claim for service the person comes and resets the TV and says everything it good and after     days same issue happens   st Issue  The screen went blank and only audio came without video   nd Issue  Video stuck and audio continues and remote does not work   rd Issue  Sometimes Remote does not work   th  There is some little gap in between the outside panel and the screen and when I showed it to the service person he says it is normal due to sensors present that gap is visible but there is no sensor present in the middle   th  User interface sucks   th  Bluetooth connectivity issue  Multiple times I reported and the service person comes and resets the TV and leave    th  Connectivity b w TV and remote is the worst  All the time the TV sucks  Do not go for it  If you want a     TV in the budget go for MI or RealMe  OnePlus Y series is worst in the entire OnePlus lineup 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Sir   i have buyed it last few days in starting four to five days its working perfectly and now its going to blur video quality and not happy with this product if company has send their executive to check it so its good otherwise it not a good and there is no customer support from this product also   sir i m trying to cl again and again but there is not a good response from their side please pay attention regarding this and resolve this problem as the earliest 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Tv got delivered in good condition and installation went wellcoming to the tv picture quality it is awesome   Got all ott applications   had a problem with oneplus connect app connecting to TVI have seen many complaining about sound but in my opinion its crazy  i want to tell you guys   thing if you want theatre experience go to theatre its a TV not a sound system so stop complaining about sound At last go for it do not change your mind on other companies and waste timeAs these r my early days ill update abt the TV again after a monthupdatesound and picture quality are crazyoneplus connect app is laggyhaving issues with screen mirroring hoping for the update  directly   But i have no issue with screen mirroring from youtube  prime       applicationssupports  rd party applications alsoas the ram is low it takes time to load apps once cache is formed apps open at good speedRi  now best tv in budget segment
Smartdevices,2,OR,  The screen gets blurry after      minutes
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Picture Quality is quite Amazing and I am fully satisfied with that picture quality  Gamma engine is one of the major plus point in this  Comming to Remote Control  it is some what average  even if we click on the buttons on the remote some times it will not function and sometimes when we we are watching channels in the set top box  it abruptly comes back to home UI inteface not sure why it is happening  may be it will be getting updates in further comming days  Now coming to sound  I did not like the Sound much  when we are watching any TV channels which are connected through Set top box  it is Okay and when we are watching any movies in Netflix or Prime Video  Sound is totally disaster  even we can not hear the dialogues clearly  This is one thing that I was disappointed a lot  Now I must plan to buy a sound bar  If the TV sound quality is good  I may not buy this  This is the thing that OnePlus must definitely look into it  If you want good picture quality and you previously have a speaker sound bar then you can blindly go to this  If you are not having any of the sound bars speakers the choice will be of your own 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been an One Plus fan since I got the One Plus  T  Upon a lot of convincing my Dad finally trusted a One Plus TV as he is traditionally a fan of Samsung  Panasonic and other  established  TV s  The One Plus TV not only has impressed him but the prompt installation and customer support has helped increase his faith in an otherwise  new  company  Coming to the TV the picture quality is amazing and the voice recognition along with Alexa works like a charm  Despite many negative reviews on the sound quality I found it satisfactory and absolutely upto the mark  I do not NEED ANY EXTERNAL SPEAKERS as the sound quality is DAMN GOOD  Coupled with a good high speed Wifi this TV is a STEAL at this price  Other smart LED TV s are   k expensive and with no other Notable increase in any features  as I have seen in many of my friends homes  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Is this a fake not a dolby atmos speaker  voice quality is not clearity at high end volume  and remote is too much laggy too much slow work on tv and tv is also laggy after back on any app  and you want to  go home screen is time to take also    second   badi  badi Baatey or vadapaun khate  is that true dilounge for oneplus and   another problem amazon installation service is provided me wall mount stand of mi brand  not oneplus brand
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I received the TV delivery on   th March  It is said that the installation will be done in   days  but I can find out by calling customer care on   th  they do not have any installer here  so they tell me to wait till   th  But today my product is canceled or  replacer last date   So today I installed   TVs with local mechanic  I do not have any complaint about delivery or product  But I will give a big zero to Amazon about installation  So mind it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Writing this review after using it for a month I am using this as just smart tv not with any cable connection or DTH service   Sharpness gets set to   automatically out of no where and you will watch your tv playing everything in black   white and once this happens TV never works the same as before    Picture quality is not so great    TV gets hang in all the applications    it will go back to initial screen while you are watching something    Sometimes it works as radio you play some video but you can only hear it and entire screen will become blank    Amazon warranty claim service is pathetic  I have raised a request and waited for   days still no technician had visited from OnePlus to provide service and amazon does not have any information regarding that  simply they offer this service
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I purchased tv but in a month when I connected amazon fire stick i realized the ARC HDMI port was not functioning  I filed complaint to ONEPLUS first and Amazon then  The Technician never visited my home after his only first visit in NOV       Always made false reporting  always rescheduling and cancelling visit appointments and even after then just updating  waiting for parts  I thank Amazon who accepted return of my television in January      and till  th March      he was making false reporting  ultimately i told him about my return of television and he ended the service        I HAVE TO SURRENDER A GOOD TELEVISION  just a small defect  BECAUSE OF THE PATHETIC SERVICE   Later I purchased Hisense   A  F from FLIPKART with   years complete protection plan of flipkart   my OnePlus tv also had a extended warranty  protection policy    I changed TV brand and purchase app just because of this service      I hope this feedback will take some measures which will benefit your future customers 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Was shocked to receive product with no plastic covers  it was all covered in dust inside  TV Stands plastics were removed  there were no screws present  Scratches on TV back panel  Remote was also looking used I got the feeling that may be they sent me Display unit  But amazon was so prompt after I sent them pictures and coordinated on call with them  they immediately arranged for reverse pick up and I refund got initiated in    hours 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Good but some issues     Remote sensor is not good   when connect with other device there is difference between audio  video   on   off automatically   sound quality is not good But how much we expect in        
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I chosen the product keeping one plus mobile performance and reputation in mind but since the day the product delivered nothing matched with the quality There was a free installation service with the product cart  but no one turned up till date Sound quality and picture quality is not maching the compitition Now hanging issue is increasing day by day  do not know what is fate of this product ahead 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  average picture quality  Average soundsVery poor remote response      Need huge improvement   
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Picture quality is OK   Sound quality is pathetic   For a     TV  inbuilt speakers are substanard and sound is breaking   Though they claim Dolby  there is no effect of Dolby  I have been using OnePlus mobile for the past several years   Expecting same quality  I purchased their TV also but got totally disappointed   Never expected such an experience from a reputed brand like OnePlus 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have purchased the TV along with echo dot  th generation  I was trying to add oneplus skill in Alex but TV was not getting discovered  I have called to oneplus support for the assistance but got mind blowing answer saying that due to some technical issue they have stopped the Alexa support and may be released in coming updated Amazon and oneplus both are fooling the customers by selling the incompatibility device with wrong advertisement After the issue with alexa  i have observed one more issue  I was not able to use internet even after my internet was working good  after going through multiple blogs  i found that there is some date and time issue I have again raised the complaint with oneplus support  Engineer visited and made factory reset and left I have called engineer  the issue is not resolved  The engineer has closed the service request saying that there is a problem with motherboard please raise the request again I have raised again with engineers feedback and support team has said that they have escalated the issue to manager and will receive the call back in       Hrs  I have waited for   Week and again called up  same thing they said you will receive the call back in       Hrs and this time i have waited around    Weeks and called to support for status surprisingly they have closed the issue without resolution  asked the support person with what comment they have closed but he was hiding something and said that i do not have access  again new issue request raised again In short  Please do not buy One plus TV s and do not fall for wrong advertisements of Amazon and One plus  These people are making the customers fools with name of brandRegards Mahender
Smartdevices,5,OR,  After installation and using one month I noticed that there is a problem with the Android TV it is automatically turned off  Some time its hang no function is working  I have to restart again  If you are having a good budget then go ahead with the other brands this is my personal opinion but I find this TV is not reliable  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  PLEASE do not BUY THIS SCRAP PRODUCT      I CAME TO KNOW     I WASTED        AFTER   DAYS OF USAGE   IF YOU BUY THIS DEFINALTY YOU WILL LOOSE PIECE OF MIND SAD STORY STARTS NOW    I am writing review after   days of usage   Product got delivered on   th Feb      and Installation is done on   th Feb         days after delivery    I can not able to use TV without wall mounting because of limitations at my home   Basic functionality  Display  is lost after   days of usage  I could not able to return because of return policy of    days of delivery   return button is disabled    Initially I thought it was setup box problem that after troubleshooting I came to conclusion that it was TV display problem SAD STORY CONTINUES       I raised a complaint to amazon   th march  they told that they will send a technician to check problem and scheduled appointment is on    March        Now I have wait for    days to technician to come and inspect Brand value of ONEPLUS in mobile category is GOOD   When it comes to TV   ONEPLUS made a scarp product  If basic functionality display is not working as expected      ITS BRAND VALUE IS ZERO Coming to AMAZON      I did not buy a product on road side PLATFORM   did not expect worst service from AMAZON for SCRAP product  Inspection after    days after complaint SAD STORY CONTINUES        do not know if AMAZON will help me or not
Smartdevices,1,OR,  In just   months of using  that screen started to get some lines  later in jus   days it went completely blank  seller is refusing to repair it in warrenty  very poor service by the seller  Will update the review if Amazon helps me resolve this issue  When things like this happen  you really lose faith in online purchasing of such items 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  TV is basic  speakers are average and need to get external soundbar  Installation delayed and not happened yet  Also it does not support  G internet so not sure if it can stream high quality videos 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I will be brief here Unboxing No wall Mount No Display cables Plastic stands Thin TVPathetic service given by mezone  still notbody come for mounting stand service person ask for wall Mount Amount  Job request has been cancled by client still I am waiting for service but no bodies listing to me i will be never purchase any product from amezon Pros Contrast Ratio is Amazing  Black level is amazing Viewing angles r fine Awesome Colour accuracy Latest Android version Cons Poor quality Speakers Little bit laggy  probably the OS The panel is awesome  TV will not lag when playing video  and its really okay  android phones have similar issues As for speakers  why would you use inbuilt speakers What matters most is Contrast Ratio  Colour range  viewing angles  and clarity They r all good in this price range  no   k   k    FULL HD TV could do better AMAZON INSTALLATION I did not get the wall mount  because installation guys were charging me for it TV is good  Amazon Service is getting poorer
Smartdevices,4,OR,  it is been a week since I Have been using OnePlus TV     inch Here is my observation Price  I had a very good offer with my Amex points and sale from Amazon Picture quality I would       Picture Sound   Voice recognition    Weight  it is just  KG  very lite and hence very delicate Boot process I felt bit slow  but manageable for an Android TV Amazing Amazon Delivery and very quick installation  It appears for now a pretty smart buy for me 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Date   th AugustVery very pathetic display quality  Even HD channel is not clear  Colour spread all over the places  completely Blurry display  Sound is also poor  Very noisy sound quality  This is not expected from One plus  Contacted amazon they said TV can not be returned on the basis of display quality  Felt cheated  and for one plus lovers  a big disappointment Date   th AugustAfter inspection by Amazon authorised Agent  the return has been accepted  Thank god I got rid of this mess 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I brought this tv at the republic day sale and I regret taking this tv Let me start with the good points about the tv  The sleek and Bazel less design   User Interface is pretty good Pain Points   The installation experience has been pathetic and I in fact got it after a week of follow up and complaint raising   The tv is terribly slow   The booting of the TV takes a lot of time and Screen to Screen lag time is very high   In the first week itself  The google assistant stopped working and I raised further complaints  the service guys then said that they will replace the remote but till now   No further response   The colour and contrast combinations are pretty bad 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Actually I Bought the On Nov      and I Upgraded Normal setop Box To Hd settopBox after  days   Since i Upgraded From normal to hdbox facing Those issue Screen Flickering Lagging   Those and all   As I thought it would be becoz Of Weather problem As Nirav is Going And after few days Facing the same issue and i Kept service for settopbox they took the box for service and said there is nothing problem in the settop its Becoz of Tv   Problems facing of tv  Hdmi port   screen flickering and lagging  Hdmi port  No Audio only VideoWhile we update apps on Playstore its keeps on Asking For agaian anad again  ChromeCast lag    Its Keeps On Asking Retrieving Data When I Plugin Hdmi port    Since i kept for Replace they are saying return or replace window closed On    november  I am Just one day delay I kept complaint on   Nov And they are Saying Contact OneplusCare     None Of the One plus Care Agent Contacted me And Assisting Me    living with a Fault Tv    Its Been    we Are Not Watching The TV   Veryy Bad Waste Of Money    I think Amazon Could Help me  My Concern is Provide Me A Replace   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  First of all one star for Amazon not for tv from buying to installation every thing is pathetic     First if you want to buy this item you should have prime membership first condition   After becoming the  prime member  TV is delivered after seven days it is a joke from Amazon and it shows that  they do not take their prime members  seriously   And I have to wait for    Freaking days for insatallation   Then that insatallation guy really he is a fraud he charged me     rupees for wall mount and before coming for installation he asked  there is two wall mount one is local of     rupees and another one is from one plus of      rupees so I choose the     one which is from one plus which is doubt full    One plus should add wall mount barcket in the box so these fraud installation guy can not receive any one  after Amazon does not take the liability of this they said that this is  the genuine price and I  doubt it because he did not bring the wall mount bracket in retail box and making excuse that he do not have enough space in his bag     This is  the first time I am  buying anything from Amazon and I buy disappointem not a tv  from Amazon again thanks Amazon for this shipment experience     Now for tv is ok picture quality is decent but sound is not that great it is loud but not clear  it could have been better connectivity is good just like everyone is saying that tv lags not in my case remote work superb no lags and everything else is ok
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Data saver mode is absent from my TV  This is the biggest setback for me  Although they are still showing data saver mode in product description on Amazon Hope they fix this in their update 
Smartdevices,1,OR,   OnePlusDon t ever buy OnePlus products  I buy a OnePlus TV which got faulty in a week and now continuously following up with customer care over the calls and emails but they are just promising the it will be resolved in next    hours but neither they are providing any support nor they have any service center I would strongly not recommend to buy OnePlus products  The worst service ever from OnePlus 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The TV is excellent  no issues with the same  However  the installation of the TV leaves a lot to be desired  The technician deputed to do the installation are ill equipped to do the same  They do not have proper tools or bits for the installation and are in a hurry to leave  They have little no knowledge of the features in the TV and seem ignorant  There standrard reply is see the video on youtube  Dissapointed with the installation  had to get the same installed privately by making payments  Other than that the TV is good  worth the price 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  UI not smooth as they shown Less ram  less internal storage makes UI worst do not buy for OnePlus brand only  after sale service not good as their phones For that same price iffalcon k    TCL brand  K  gb memoryEspecially no lagging
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Bought this TV on  nd march      and by   th march I could find that half of the  TV screen has got  blurred  You can refer the below screenshots     March     As soon as i found the issue  I have scheduled an appointment with the DIGICARE services and warranty The service was scheduled to   rd march but  the technician did not show up and left my calls unattended    March     Reached the Amazon service centre and they assured me to get the issue fixed by the end of the day but  they did not show up too and now I am still waiting for the Technician to resolve the issue    March     Technician reached me and inspected the tv for any physical damages  no damages found and he confirmed  that this is due to defective screen of the One  TV 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Never expected this from Amazon and from One Plus  After   months of usage screen started flickering and complaint registered on amazon and one plus during dec  st week      its been one month over still the issue is not resolved  Thank you amazon for not taking the customer complaints on time  Thank you one plus for not valuing your customers Please do not but anything from amazon 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Absolutly stunning Oneplus did a great job    Picture quality   awesome   imersive    Sound is literallty more than enough for a large hall  Bass sourround sound  loudness and quality is just great  If you turn the volm  To max    you are going to feel as if a large  saadi wala dj   is in your room     Google assitant    blutooh pairing   screen cast  all installed apps works seamlessly   No laging issues at all    Bezels are extremely thin   If you watch tv from a distance  you can not say even tv has bezels or not    Build quality is just great   Tv is very light weight      One word review   best value for money  literally 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Plz Help Regarding my Tv One Plus Y series   I need Replacement Becoz Tv have Issue in HDMI port Pictures are flipping and One Plus does not Have Parts Waiting From Last   weeks while I ordered recently this One new Tv
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Bad TV     do not go for it    you will regret   to switch on this TV the remote given is useless   not everytime you press the on button the TV will get switched on   it depends on the mood of the remote   it gets hanged also sometimes   voice quality is ok    Sometimes it gets quiet inaudible
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Being a hard core OnePlus brand  it very hard to digest the worst quality TV supplied by OnePlus  The producy delivered to me is a faulty one with defective display pannel  it is only showing lack of quality assurance by the brand which is known for providing quality products within the reach of common people  I hope OnePlus will seriously listen to these issue in future and take all the steps to recitlfy the problems in their system 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Picture quality is good  Issues with sound quality  but on customizing the sound from settings  the sound quality improves a lot  At this price point  it is quite good  If one is happy using YouTube  AmazonPrime  Netflix  which are pre installed  you are not going to face any issues of lag Most importantly  found  Made in India  written on the back panel of the TV  So  one can prefer this product from other available at same price range 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great TV for the price  Been using it for two months now  updates have seem to resolved some issues  yet the TV freezing up sometimes still persist  but on the contrary the picture quality is just amazing  if you have a decent internet or a hd setup up box it will support dolby audio 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Was excited about TV from OnePlus and was eager to buy one  Bought the OnePlus TV assuming that it would have certain quality standards  This TV turned out to be a bad purchase  Within   hours of watching the TV  noticed black patches in white screen across the panel  Have attached the pic  Called up AZ customer care and they confirmed that this is an issue   This was my worst TV buying experience  pitchure quality was the worst   Never OnePlus TV  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst TV ever to buy   manufacturing defect in the replaced product also and one plus denies to agrees for it and asking       for repair of the product   fruad  even Amazon is denying the promise made to me to provide free of cost service after making promising me for service for whole one month   fraud by amazon n oneplus   never buy products from Amazon n one plus
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Hardware specs are amazing for this product however the software is still in development  So sometimes it may not feel polished and some lags when opening or installing apps  Reboots helps reduce the lags  but until oneplus team manages better software you will be stuck with it  The good news is this is android so you may be able to install a custom rom for more polished experience 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have purchased one plus tv    inch from amazon  after purchase with in    days time my tv screen got blured completely so i done the complain in one plus than they replaced my complete pannel of tv  its been only    more days and once again this screen got blured  its showing blank  suddenly it got went of and one more thing this one plus tv for this they guys have provided customer care number on that number nobody will reply till you call them for continuously for   hour  i want my money back please help and i request amazon to take my this feedback seriously and band this one plus tv from selling  i am going to put this detail feedback on all my socialmeadia connectionONE PLUS TV ARE THE MOST PATHETIC TV I HAVE EVER PURCHASED  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Tv was very good in terms of picture quality  Sound is manageable to some extent  Internal featutes and wifi everything works pretty good  In remote two of the buttons were not functioning but voice wise it is able to recognize but  tv is quite lacking 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have bought the TV on    Oct      on Amazon Great Indian festival sale  And my honest comment is    Slowness while using Android and Chromecast     Poor audio quality    When Wifi is switched on then tv automatically off and change from cable or antenna to android  So again we have to use the TV remote and change it back to cable    Youtube crashed some time so we have to switch off and switch on it again 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I love OnePlus products and I hve a device bullets as wel TV  all there products r too good n I will surely recommend all my frndz and family members to purchse TV  dolbby version in TV has got a amazing audio effects  I am proud to tell all my frndz dat am an OnePlus user and own it  never expected dat I would really feel so comfortable using TV also there z a very good quick response form customer service also itz easy to book a repair frm OnePlus care app  as world z becoming smarter even booking a repair z so simple by using user friendly app and the technician repairs it in front of our eyes which is really amazing and happy to tell woooow and a big salute to OnePlus brand Cheers Manjunath Rey

Smartdevices,3,OR,  The picture quality is not up to the mark conpared to the other models of similar price  the size of the tv is small  poor sound quality

Smartdevices,1,OR,  Brought a TV It worked for    days And then the tv dsnt wana turn on Never expected  this kind of thing from one plus Very poor Also the best part is they have many complaints like that coming for this model Its so evident that knew there is some issue with this model of product and its  still its out for sale And now i am being waiting for a tech to visit me from   days Guys this is for any one who is buying this particular product Plese please think twice I dnt knw anything abt other product though this model of tv has some problems not worth the humiliation  and tension 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  After a month of usage   Switch ON TV takes     seconds post pressing Power button over Remote  Clear indication or LAG     While using DTH  have to use   remotes  OnePlus TV remote to Switch ON Off  increase decrease volume and Airtel DTH remote   do not know if it is how the OnePlus TV remote is designed that it will not sync with Airtel DTH remote or something else     Sometimes there is no sound while TV is switched ON while on DTH  To fix it  I restart TV and it works  Not sure if it is the software issue for Live TV or issue with DTH set top box configuration  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Picture quality is okayish No  ghz connection support Audio quality is so poor that you may want to return the tv back Installation is poorly done by  rd party service   costs       for wall mounting I would suggest to add some more money and go for Samsung  Sony or Panasonic do not get tempted by price Poor quality from oneplus  did not expected that 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Have been using oneplus TV for more than   months now  Excellent purchase  Good picture quality  good audio output  great features  Since its android  you can install apps from built in google playstore app in the TV  I use an iPhone  no issues while casting mobile to TV screen The only thing i dislike is that it sometimes glitches while switching between apps  Hope OnePlus fixes it soon with updates  An excellent TV in this price range  Go for it 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I ordered the tv   it is a good tv at this price range  After receiving the tv Amazon is unable to Install it because of their technical problem  I wait for some days for their suggestion  But they failed to provide me support  that is why I returned it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  as the name goes      is best of the lots  read lot of reviews and was bit reluctant to buy the product  but still brought it after lot of comparison  I am posting review after   weeks of installation  Have not faced any lagging as suggested in earlier review  This can be concluded that my WI FI is working fine  when the speed of Wi Fi slows down than the tv starts lagging  I have not experienced and screen flicking till now  voice recognition is good overall a nice buy we are mainly casting our videos through phone as we do not want to utilize the TV memory 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  TV started showing issues just on   th day   Amazon is now paying games saying its other departments who is handling this   we can not replace as its more than    days  I raised calls     times they say they will get back in    hours   no one responds   do not buy    or any electronics from Amazon  as you will not get you r warranty sorted Cons    TV display quality is bad   sound is BAD   TV do not wake up from Standby with   key press    AMAZON service SUCKS    no response
Smartdevices,1,OR,  TV Not working from Day Two Onward  contacted One Plus Through Amazon for  Service no Res ponce from Company Side and Amazon side also   Finally They Cancelled Service RequestTV with me but not working  waste of MoneyDon t Buy
Smartdevices,1,OR,  After a week s analysis  I have placed an order for the OnePlus TV on Amazon  The delivery person was good enough to install and provided the Demo with very much patience  TV was working fine for that Day  The problem started the next day  Though my home WiFi is connected to the TV  it is not allowing YouTube to play and not allowing my mobile casting  I have restarted TV many times and in vain Later  I have complained to Amazon and they arranged a technician to my home and he agreed that there is an issue with the TV and suggested having a replacement 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   The products wireless card started to malfunction just after   months of purchase and worst is that the oneplus customer care does not even bother  I have raised the complaint and it has been   days   I do not have any response from oneplus care team  They just ask me to wait for few days   Worst customer care ever  I would not recommend people to go for oneplus although the price is very tempting  But if we do not get any after sea support   this is of no use   Sony and Samsung are way better though they charge a premium 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Worst product and service I have evr experienced in my entire life Technicians     did not appear on time for installation  We did it ourself with the help of local technicians  There was not any response from technicians side as well as from the company side  None helped us properly on the whole tottaly worthless product My whole family hates the product and service and also me for ordering this nonsense  I seriously regret my decision now The product went waste in three months time  It sometimes goes off by itself I have also attached how the tv works 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Unable to connect Chromecast and Bluetooth  takes much time to start apps    service also very poor from Amazon    did not expect this from OnePlus
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I was skeptical at first because of the negative reviews regarding the sound quality  but after tinkering with a few settings I managed to increase the volume  The TV has amazing picture quality and sound quality is way better the previous tv I owned 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   The TV is overall perfect picture quality and sound  The only question over here is of reliability  i bought this tv on    September but facing problems with it since then and when i raise a complaint it starts working fine automatically  And magically it occurs again after   month Faced the issue again last week and this time the issue still existed when the service person came Please see the video attached and decide  This video was taken by the service technician that visited  Overall i rate this TV   star because if reliability 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  I got    inch version  Good at this price point I had to replace it once  The first TV I got was on older OS version updated on Jun   this was buggy and had lot of issues   can not update the OS  Update was not working  I was not able to add Google account  YouTube was not workingBut  the replacement I got had new OS version  updated on Sep  and it resolved all above issue It seems good and stable enough  But  still software improvements are needed I am happy with sound quality and picture quality  Well good enough as per this price point 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am not sure if the customer care even exist for one plus Y series  tried reaching them twice but no luck  The first time they closed the request stating I was not reachable  second time no call so far  Not sure if it is me who is facing the issue or if anyone else please do highlight  My suggestion do not go for this brand when you the likes or sony and LG and others 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst experience after buying this can not able to replace after    days of usage there was a lone on the screen services at its worst  Feeling disappointed with this product bought n flash sale one mnth EMI only paid bt issues cmng day by day
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The installation executive charged me Rs        cash for wall mounting brackets since they are not included in the price of the TV  This information should have been clearly mentioned on the product description but it was not Also  initially I was very disappointed with the sound output of the TV  The installation executive said that this is the best possible  But later when I adjusted the sound settings from the menu the sound output increased dramatically 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worst TV i had ever seen in my life   its turn into black and white TV after using    days and many more problems with its I had requested for repair in September     and still waiting for repair  Its more then three months and its shows waiting for parts   ever i called many times to oneplus customer care regarding this  And they provide only new dates not solution  Totally Fed up with oneplus service   Never purchase oneplus TV   Its my request to you all 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Got this product delivered on  th Nov        By March      the device became faulty  Contacted amazon customer service and they promised to send a technician within   hrs  Unfortunately no one contacted us or came to us for servicing the device  So contacted the customer care again and received the same reply that they will send the technician within   hrs   Today a person rang me from OnePlus and said that the technician will come within a week  So whom should I believe  Before this incident I had huge admiration for OnePlus but now if any one asks me I will not recommend OnePlus
Smartdevices,3,CG,  No wall mount attached to this TV  Bad installation experience
Smartdevices,4,OR,  This TV also not working with Alexa  Amazon provide wrong information  Both Tv  i have            both tv not working with Alexa   I request to Amazone please do not provide wrong        time i called customer care they also not provide any solution regarding this issue    time they sent technician and they also faild to connect Alexa with TV  And the major thing is Technician do not knw how to connect Alexa  Both time they came and check only Tv 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Tv was not what was shown in the description  Whole plastic body was looking very cheap  besides the rate was also cheap  but at first i thought one plus would not deliver cheap product even at cheap price  but i was proved wrong I returned the tv as there was some technical issue where tv was showing blue screen when turned on after few hours in standby mode  and only solution was to turn it off completely and then again turn on  so finally i decided to get rid of the tv and as there was no replacement available i got a refund 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The television we got on   th of this month The installation team has not arrived to install my product and so I do not know the picture or sound or remote control quality The scheduled installation date was on   th of September I have called the Amazon team thrice  I got a number from the costomer care and I called several Times through out the day s may be    plus Times  Once they attended the call and replied me that they will check and revert to me and then on no answering So I will give this negative review I am really fed up with this product and since    day s it is in the box  And now I do not want the crapy product Vere vere very bad from the Amazon team If the installation team has any problem they should respond to me  And I do not think even the Amazon is taking proper action  Really bad 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I ordered this during the festival sale  This product was delivered and installed on time  Coming to the product the HDMI ports were not working properly  One port was not working at all and I was seeing a pinkish screen on the other port  Amazon did not let me replace the tv and I had to reorder the tv at       higher price than before  The new tv was delivered after more than    days   And the installation date provide was one week after that  So for getting a working tv I had to wait for       days  The service provided by amazon during this festival sale was no where near the mark set up by them previously 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  First product had wifi connection problem  I had to connect to mobile hotspot first before connection to home WiFi is established  Technician told me to replace item  The replaced product also had WiFi issue  Tv time needed to be set correctly every time tv is started  Oneplus technician told there is software issue and they are waiting for next update  I can not rely on that  Returned second item as well  I am getting some other brand now Otherwise tv seemed fine when I was able to play it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I seriously recommend you not to purchase one plus products TV  in    days it got problem with blank screen and flickering  from last  months I am behind customer care and service centre guys  No one till the day is responding  and even after more than    mails sent to support team  OnePlus is not supporting any tv which is purchased fron Amazon as they said 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  With in one month  All hdmi ports stopped working    Remote sensor is at right bottom of tv   so everytym tym you want to operate using remote   you have to point ur remote there  this is painful  Sound quality is ok but volume is less oneplus software is ok   decent   but it is little laggy  overall for this price it is ok but there are quite some issues which needs to be fixed in this TV  i would say avg product Not so great   not so bad either 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Poor Quality TV at low cost Poor display Poor sound quality Extremely slow procesor You can not see the TV for long time Not a eye friendly Delivered with damage display Returned the same Amazon should stop selling poor quality product to maintain their quality standard 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Amazon   oneplus                       oneplus    inch Tv     work                                                  Amazon   oneplus                
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Showing no connection  with buletooth  and wifi devices  poor built quality  The technician from also came and he suggested to replace this unit  but Customer care executive give me another appointment of technician  Why the replacement or return of item is not available  if the Customer is not satisfied   After investing  money  more than other brands   this model of tv is not value for money 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I regret buying this oneplus Tv  I just bought your    inch TV last week or so thro Amazonlast couple of days I find that the tv uis having some problemWhen I am watching channels  suddenly it goes off to the home screen  it is not coming coming backNow I regret buying your tv Their after sales is very poor  to attend a call they ask me to wait for    mins   My God
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The system hangs and gets turned off itself  I am tired of complaining about the product and have filed the complain thrice and there is no response from the service team  they have disappointed and ruined my experience from buying the product from amazon and one plus products  I am never going to recommend one plus products anymore to anyone  On the first visit  technician asked to visit make a video when it gets turned and talked with inappropriate manner  it is my third complaint so far and they have ruined my experience 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Facing many lagsSound voice is low  back ground voices noisy nd  disturbing  while watching any showsDisplay little FlickeringPicture more saturatedRemote connectivity slowSuddenly it is restartsVery laggyMany bugsOne plus waste I ordered product aug      But untill now no installation   installation team will escape ny saying false statements So finally after    days i got installation by my own   amazon will provide money for installation just     amazon pay balance No proper response from amazonBetter go for high end models
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Changing my review after   months Firstly  it does not start normally as you have to wait for a whileSecondly  after it starts  it goes to home screen by its ownAlso  Poor display and sound quality     Cheap panel and its not OnePlus brand quality  
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I think that one plus is best on all products but this time I am very less appreciated with one plus Y series   inch TV  The device is too much lagWhen I use remote it does not work and suddenly it will working very fastly It seems look like  that you are playing pubg with high graphics in   gb ram phones I am very disappointed 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Met my expectations   Ratings relative to the price segment    Good Build quality          Beautiful Display  Rich in colours           Fair Sound quality         Smooth Android experience        
Smartdevices,5,OR,  It is One Plus  No need to write anything  Picture quality is good  Everything is good  It comes with android  You will never get this type of product in this prise tag  I am making this statement after through market research But internal video player could be better  It never resumes your playback Overall I am fully satisfied and happy with my decision 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  SOUND    The most disliked is the sound of Y series are dumb and one thing is the speaker comes without tweeter  its like local speakers voice PICTURE QUALITY   Good       of     Value for money    this comes for the ones budget under   k Oneplus connect   is a lit bit laggyFull plastic body not a even metal used in the body
Smartdevices,2,CG,  Awesome design but poor sound quality Apps availablity is less Lot of lag in transition between apps Please try Vu cenima tvVery disappointed at OnePlus 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  My overall experience with the product for   days  it is very bad  Tv is not working properly  Remote does not work and you can not do anything about it  Picture quality is very poor  You will not get REPLACEMENT from amazon  she will out extra  K and purchase from reputed brands  never ever dream to go for OnePlus  Be cautious  you will not get any product support from amazon and you have to live with a defective product  Visit a nearby showroom and purchase from them  this is what I wish to do right now    after living with a defective product  Atleast you do not need to worry about after sales support 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best in this price range  we can expect moreI am using since    of july undoubtedly picture quality is too good sound is also good as compare to other brands There is an issue while opening any app  i think it will get optimized after next update  that they are providing in September 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Unable to connect tv remote app on phone TV looks great  Sound quality is also good Picture colours are good but it looks pixelated Remote is responsive  android os is responsive  no lag It is not good enough for me considering there are other options 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The screen cast is not supported by the TV it is been  months for the TV and the display started to flicker with a black line vertically on the display Further the repair  return service against the warranty is not very customer friendly  I have been trying to avail the warranty service but no positive response received from the other side 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Sound quality needs to be improved   and you can use HD only less than  TB which is major disadvantage  Any USB device more than  TB will not work Good installation team  supportive   helpful 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have not seen like this before  Everyone must try this tv    Picture quality is awesome  sound quality wonderful  apps downloading perfect speed   for usage and all very perfect    very good tv for who love the smart tvs  but small connectivity problems are there in starting time    but it is ok now   then guys plz do not trust the tv fixing from amazon side    they think v r fool   they did not come to fixing and all i tried to call them but they said like  i was resigned so I am not the responsible person so plzz do not trust them guysWorst service i have ever seen  even dono the service persons who will going to come for TV service 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Picture quality was goodSoftware running smoothlyLike it very muchBut within a day display started problems like flickering white May be I got defective product I think so I returned it
Smartdevices,1,CG,  High price
Smartdevices,2,OR,  I am a Prime customer and usually order all my electronics and other stuff from Amazon and I am happy with the services  One Plus Y series was a Nice Deal but during the order there was no clear guidelines for Amazon Eco Dot offer and I ordered as per the details mentioned there but I did not get Eco Dot and I contacted customer care but they were also not able to get me the offer  I am a Prime customer but disappointed with my experience with this order  I have read the terms and conditions during that time and it was not present and later on added by seller or Amazon 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  TV is excellent when it comes to picture quality and sound but comes with few issues    Google assistant is not easily operational   Installation is said to be free including wall mount but the installation guy came and asked for Rs      for wall mount bracket so I did not wall mount it Good thingsPicture quality
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Bluetooth and Wifi did not worked on this so called SMART TV  Even Pathetic Amazon service  They kept on suggesting TV inspection even after I confirmed that every normal check was done and TV was reset based upon suggestion from Oneplus technical support After endless calls and   days they agreed for replacement which was to be done in    DAYS WHILE NEW TV WAS AVAILABLE NEXT DAY  I have instead retuned it and bought a Sony TV 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very bad performance  Lots of lag  Video goes to home screen every   min  And do not replace warranty due to this issue  Also screen quality is pathetic  Screen display is very bad 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I would never recommend anyone to buy oneplus smart tv  because their after sales service is worst  I bought   tv on amazon and within   weeks its remote stopped working so i file a complaint request for replacement repair over call on    november and they said that service person will come within   days  And still no one came and i tried to call again more than    times but never get connected to customer care executive over call as it is always shows busy  My complaint ref  no  Is SYULC QOHCCA  My next step wound be to go to consumer court and sue oneplus soon 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Premium look awesome picture quality Unable to connect echo dot   Remote is also looking nice but main thing is that processing speed is slow Sometimes Sony LIV and Zee  app stuck Rest given Chromecast and mobile share for OnePlus is nice facilities Guys sound quality is not upto the mark Rest in this price this okay 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  If you want to waste your money then buy this tv  I had also bought thinking of OnePlus brand value But this tv can not even connect to wifi and if it gets connected miraculosly  it will automatically disconnect after    or    minutes  OnePlus should drop the name smart tv as it cannot even connect to wifi  So I returned it do not go only by brand name  OnePlus do not have any experience in making TV s  So avoid oneplus TV s  look for alternative brands 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst tv experience that I have ever had   in my life with this TV  worst customer service experience and service  Amazon kept the promise of contacting the manufacturer   which was to harsh for a month old TV  TV had bad screen issue remote issue  waiting for the drama to get over from the one plus side
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I Purchased the product last month in Diwali sale and overall I am satisfied with the product quality  But in comparison to the other brand s like MI   Realme etc price is on the little higher side  If the rice is a little bit lower side it will be a higher selling product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not make a mistake purchasing this device as mine stopped working within a month of purchase  Even the remote control is faulty and shuts the TV down just by pointing towards with without any button press The service centre guys will not respond to the complain for more than    days  They will not even respond either 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Pathetic TV  It does not connect to the sony     music system  the guy who came was just in a hurry to fix it and run  did not clearly explain things and did not give solution to connect the home theatre despite asking him   Day   it is not detecting set top box even though the hdmi is plugged in properly   having a tough time with the tv   the biggest mistake in my life was to go for this TV    I will give ZERO STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT Suggestion   Spend a little more and get a better established television brand
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst ever experience with one plus  could not pair my iPhone with chrome cast   Very second day the display issue popped up   Contacted amazon for replacement and they said not possible   Bought it on emi and returning the Tv now  Lost money on emi conversation charges and GST amount by bank  Amazon never cares   Flipkart is better than amazon on customer experience  Defective products   Worse customer experience with most customer eccentric company on earth  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The Tv is really impressive in all aspects  have not tried the voice recognition and other smart features because it has just arrived  Happy with the delivery within two days of placing the order  Butter service by the providers are pathetic  The scheduled installation date was fixed but nobody came for the installation  Though I do not need installation etc but just wanted to know the service but I am really very disappointed with the service by the service providers
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Very worst TV  Got scratches on the display of the TV  Claim for check thrice and yet my query does not get resolved  Never ever buy any products from amazon  Never ever buy any products of OnePlus  Even I wanted to give negative star rating but I have to give    Completely not satisfactory product  And service is even worst
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Good product but it is not something i will appreciate like other oneplus products  Picture Quality       Sound      it makes lot of noise distortion at high volumesValue for money     
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I bought this for my bedroom  For this price its ok  Finishing of the TV is bad  The edges look odd  Picture quality is good  sound is definitely not good  its loud but not good  TV got delivered within   days and was installed at the time of delivery 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  The product was amazing   picture quality was so good sound quality of the tv is good But the tv not connecting with the mobile and Google assistant is of no use and it is not connecting to the device  The wall mount was not given with the tv  the technician is worst  he does not gave complete information about the tv   the technician does not know anything   I need abetter demo so plz send another technician   thank you
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The worst TV buy  This tv lags since the time it has booted up for the  st time  Really disappointed with it  I have used MI tv    inch which is far more superior to Oneplus  do not buy this a genuine suggestion
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good Product  Panel Quality and Sound is good  For the price it is worth  Smart functions can be bit overwhelming for some  but overall good experience  Android TV options are good  Even though YouTube may take but time to load and search  Still Highly recommend with my   days only use 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice product at this price  Quality of picture is very nice  Has got all the smart features  Voice recognition is also good  For that make sure your internet is has good singnal  Sound quality is not good  For that you have to buy sound bar  I am giving this review after a month  As if now I have not got any issue yet  But at this price I will recommend to buy OnePlus TV
Smartdevices,3,OR,  There is a problem in software bcz when it on   i see some lagging problem there  oneplus connect is not supporting properly  Picture quality is definately very good   When i go through  get more apps  in apps section i have seen two lines  so i thought it may be manufacturing fault  but now i have got another one after replacing same two lines are there in panel 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Simple trick to hang the TV Play any vedio on YouTube Off the TV frm remote On the TV frm remote The OnePlus Y series TV get hang  noting works unless you unplugged and plugged in again Plz try with your One Plus Y series TV and share your feed back The TV software is not properly tested and launch in Market  Some time screen get blur  only volumes come and pictures get hang It takes    to    sec to start Waiting for any Upgraded patch from OnePlus expecting to be fixed with software upgrade Picture and sound quality is good 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  One of the worst product I have never seen we watch tv only    days after that automatically switch off not powering on no proper service please do not buy the service is very very very worat  worst from OnePlus I gave complaint one month ago upto now I did not get any response please do not buy OnePlus products worst products
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Product is good but installetion service is very very bad anybody not call me I called several times to instslletion technition he did not respond finally I installed my tv through local technition do not BUY PRODUCT FROM AMAZON SERVICE NOT GOOD 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am reviewing this One plus Tv with various aspects after   th day of usage Picture quality   picture quality is quite good  Because it is full hd   the color in picture are very impressive Sound  It comes with    watt dolby speakers  Very louder but not recommend to listen in full volumeSmart features  It comes with Android    with Pre installed Prime video  Netfix and youtube  Some time you tube crashes  talked to customer care  they said they are working on it In nutshell it is satisfactory with this price range 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  This is the slowest TV I ever used do not waste your money Pathetic display clarity Remote functions are dead slow Amazon refused to offer HDFC cash back Contacted many times  Amazon Agents are irresponsible and still it is pending 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product I love OnePlus but I hate that TV because poor build quality    White edges on bottom of Tv and Screen Flickering is the most common problem   Half of the times  TV does not start with a single button press    Booting takes atleast    seconds   Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time    System lag is the maximum in this class of TV s
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Picture quality is damn good  Chromecast is working good  There is some issues with the remote i think Now  the sound    It is ok ok   Simple cheap speakers are far more better than the one plus tv speaker  But i checked all the reviews and all before so compared to other    inch TVs in the market OP is best in all the things except sound  Sometimes it is loud   sometimes not audible at all  I am trying to figure out something for sound 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Into one month everuthing was working fine    But now the HDMI port got compliant    It take  days for amazon to arrange technician to come   After that its now  days    Till now waiting for spare parts to come    Hope everything will be covered by warranty    Edit   Its nov   th still tv is not repaired    Even amzon customer care people dnt knw what to do with this warranty   Please do not buy this tv     
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Totally waste  from day one itself tv getting hanged   and more over remote not responding while power on  volume will too noisy when we increase only good thing picture quality is good    do not plan to buy this tv
Smartdevices,1,OR,  do not buy seriously telling you guys  instead buy mi or vu tv too many bugs in one plus tv netflux and chromecast not working properly  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worst product    do not buy this one  i know its very cheap but plz do not waste your money   Its been the  st night my remote is not being able to switch on the tv    it lags hangsup many times a day sound quality is worst   go for any other brand  but not one plus    never expected this third grade quality product  there is even a colour fluctuation while playing the video sometime and its not even two days  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Please do not go for this productPoor sound quality   average picture quality  very bad remote  worst of the worst operating system Despite of reporting all this issues related to software and sound quality none of the oneplus support team bother to call back and respond to the query  Its been a month now almost I have been following up with support team   via email   calls  app   twitter the only response I got is I will get back to you within    hours but till today nobody has got back to me with any response 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am using this TV since two weeks  My honest review  One of the best picture quality and good designed like premium looks I could see may reviews about sounds quality  My personal experience is sound is  so good    it was clear and there is no any noise The one part i faced the issue is  screen mirroring it was very bad   I unable to connect screen mirror with one plus connect application I am connecting through   party app 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Performance is good  even it has a good clarity  I am giving it   stars cuz of the poor service  I have been complaining since one month after the purchase of the product  It still has an issue with Wi fi connectivity as well as bluetooth connectivity  It started just after a month of purchase and I have complained it for     time even still there is no response at all  Now it even has an issue with ethernet cable  ie  even after connecting ethernet cable it is showing as no internet  It has such a poor customer service 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  It is a china product  Material and voice is worst than kids toy  It hangs after    days      Worst support for claim     Support team only wasting time    Warraty repair request automitically finished without service     I m going to wait for a week otherwise going to throw this into dustbinToday on    decAmazon person telling that service to be provided by company and company technician without any service without clearing claim finished the claim    Ridiculous
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The picture quality is superb for that price point i am giving   stars only because everything is good except   no data saver mode and does not even support when you trying to update from play store   tv lags a lot of times not very fluid   the sound from the inbulit speakers is very very avg
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I recommend everyone never to buy this one plus tv ever Bought this tv in August month and just after    days cracking sound problem occurs  I complained and they took more than a month to replace the speakers but the problem is still on and the company said sorry sir we can not do anything  I just wasted my money 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  There are plenty of reviews out in youtube and here  so I will keep this short Bought it a few days ago and having used this for a couple of days I can tell you that it has amazing picture quality  sound is adequate if your usage is for an additional bedroom tv and not as your living room tv  It does lag   this is not as zippy or snappy as OnePlus phones are  The UI has pretty basic Android feel to it  oxygen tv is still in a nascent stage of development so do not expect this to blow your mind  Overall this is a good product from OnePlus 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Gap between frame and screen  Disappointing   Sound quality is very bad   Build quality is very bad
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Very good tv   Picture clarity is superb  Sound quality is not too good  Will need to add a sound bar  Alexa dot does not help in improving the sound quality  Instead using wireless bluetooth gives much better effect 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I brought the TV during Amazon Prime Sale  I have never expected such a cheap product from such a good brand  TV lags all the time  sometimes you have to press the on off button     times to start the TV  do not fall for the brand name  and If you really care about your moneh  stay away from Oneplus Tv 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  after one month i see lot of issues  build quality is not good  face issues with remote  finally now facing issue with video display  support team is not user friendly it is been two weeks i raised complaint no one is taking care my recommendation   in       we do not have to expect much but if it works for atleast   months i would have recommend the product but i see the difficulty in  nd week itself  so save money and go for guarantee product instead of OnePlus 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I request all the Amazon user do not buy One Plus TV it is useless TV my Tv Usb port is not working  i complain to customer care still they have not send any technical person i have complain   to   time since last    days useless customer support please buy another brand and do not waste your money in buying one plus tv
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Pros    Picture quality while connecting to the YouTube  Prime Videos i e Android Based Application is good    Sound Quality is Good Cons    While you connect DTH  picture quality is not good  and the same is reflecting as dots 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Attracted towards OnePlus brand and bought this tv for   k which was  k higher than similar products in other brands   from the day one USB port not working and the delay in technical service was horrible   day after day rescheduling happens and irritating over no of phone calls    replacement will be given after collecting the defective product by the time have already paid   months emi    Very bad experience with Amazon and pathetic one plus tv
Smartdevices,1,OR,  do not buy this TV    Not even   days   display is gone  poor service from Amazon to claim warranty As long as all good Amazon will be right choice  if any problems  they will not take care on the priority   it is been   days no action taken by them  Same I have been seeing from other customers as well  If they got an any issues  very difficult to get it fix or claim warranty 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I just love it OnePlus tv picture quality is very nice it is a hd tv but also support full hd videoSound is nice Dolby supportedI would like thanks to Amazon   OnePlus for this wonderful product     Easy to use oxygen os working nice   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Only One word   Super    I have connected with Videocon HD box  Normal SD channel also having good Clarify    Remote control with faster access  Very fast connected    Moto G  S plus Chromecasted without any problem  But unfortunately Redmi phone unable to Connect  do not know phone problem Or TV 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is just another low budget smart TV giving you all the benefits of any other similar televisions available in the market  Oneplus launched it to compete with Mi tv  But it is not worth all the hype  The remote is a let down as sometimes its very slow to respond  The picture quality is quite good  The sound quality could be improved  Overall  it is not bad for the price you get it for 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  OnePlus has rolled out a perfect TV   like it is phones  Good picture quality  display  UI and remote  Direct option to switch to youtube  Netflix   primevideo  The Google assistant works perfectlyNeed bit improvement in sound quality Best pacy in least price
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Echo dot does not work with the TV as advertised and is awaiting a software update so buying an echodot as a bundled offer with the One Plus TV is not helping   The TVs picture quality can be a bit better and really not upto the Mark as it is advertised  The TV apps is a bit slow and hangs at times   The Remote functioning is not as agile comparing a VU or any typical brand   Overall not a pleasant experience and  not expected from One Plus  I have a feeling Oneplus is compromising on the quality at various ends  
Smartdevices,5,OR,  First of all Thank You Amazon and One plus   Really love it   Very good picture quality   it is  k not Support but full HD     p it is very clear to watch   And voice recognition it is clear   Remote control it is awesome   Love its   it is really budget prize   Worth to buy it    inch One Plus TV   Welcome  To our Family in one plus    TV Installation service was very delay   But very good service   Thank you for installation service  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The picture quality is so crisp   I can actually feel it is like  k   though it is not completely  k The sound is far better than most of the already popular brands  The remote response is amazing Total worth 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Not working since   month   Done complaint in both amazon and oneplus   worst customer service from both side   they have not repaired till now nor replaced it   do not buy this product   Worst product   Motherboard problem is every common in this series and worst customer service is provided to this product
Smartdevices,1,OR,  do not buy this  One plus is selling faulty products online and there is no support or replacement available  We discovered that My TV s  mother board is faulty just after the    days and called there customer support  They promised to replace the mother board but it is been more than a month and the customer support has no answer why it is not replaced yet and simply asking for more time Can someone suggest if consumer forum can help in this regard 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have exchanged Samsung TV to buy    TV very bad quality sound and picture i will never recomand to buy this    tv model i have made mistake by giving my old TV deal all pls do not do that mistake
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Never buy this TV  I have bought with   K   After    days TV Display is not working   I am behind service care to get repair this   TV was delivered on   th Sept  I have raised a complaint on  rd October but still no action taken either from Amazon or Oneplus  Very bad decision made by me   Regretting  
Smartdevices,1,CG,    it is very worst product   do not buy this product    Service is very very worst   Warranty claim also delay for the product    Tv spare parts not available   Customer service person also delayed for this issue
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The Y series Oneplus Tv is the worst when it come to the performance Sound System is poor for standard size hall   it lags too much    The input ports are not proper  It does not recognise sometimes the input device Picture Quality is Ok Ok The device lags too much which makes the picturequality look bad The services of the OnePlus Tv is the Worst One Should not buy OnePlus TV Y series  Go for the Trusted TV brands
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Even though the TV is a very good deal  the service is pathetic  Amazon is just playing with us fromThe last   months  apparently the TV has some missing motherboard parts and the warranty claim people does not lift the call  If you are looking to spend your money on a TV which should last long  Then this is definitely not it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The worst tv I have ever seen  they said free installation but no one came to install   customer care is not responding the Tv automatically switch off in between  The sound system is ok the tv is not working properly  I bought it  week before I need a quick response from Amazon team plz give me a suggestion I do not know what to do no hopes and I am from middle class family it is our first LED TV  it made me hopeless plz sir send me your tv installation boy it is my request 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Product was very good but had worst blasting speakers   one plus does not have good customer service for TV  Since it was manufacturing defect Amazon took return  Else one plus customer service was non existent  Learnt a big lesson  Better to spend  k more and go for Samsung
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Everything is fine at this price i believe you cannot get a good brand and this quality  Its just tv lags a bit but it is negligible  At this price it is the best tv and picture plus sound quality is too good 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  You will get what you pay for  i had high hopes at first and ordered it through amazon The installation service by one plus is satisfactory but the television is where it all spills  it will work properly for the first couple of months and then the experience gets really laggy The contrast is really bad and the sound quality is average It is a one time investment  please go for sony or Samsung by spending more but do not buy this   stars out of   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  We are used to bulky television sets  When this set arrived and was unboxed  it had an air of non seriousness  It looks like a large touch screen mobile phone  But once you switch it on  it packs quite a punch in terms of the screen quality  The remote is very user friendly  I have an issue with the sound though  it is not that great  But for the money I paid for this product  I can not expect everything to be perfect  Overall a decent product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worst product and unprofessional service  do not buy  I have been cheated by One plus for selling sub standard product  Within   month of purchase  panel is not working and no response from last    days on repair request  such an unprofessional company  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Been   days   So far it is good  I trust Oneplus for quality and design  Remote hangs sometimes and the installation guy tells you nothing about how to use or what  Basically his work is to mount the TV on wall and that is it  Sound is okay but eventually you have to buy soundbar  Beacuse if you are planning for good movie watching experience sound is not great   But that is okay  Best is the picture quality  it is almost like  kOverall a great product for this price  If they can improve on remote hangs it is perfect 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  One of the best product technology wise  just go for it   sounds perfect  picture quality great   remote is cute   this is a smart Android TV   Voice Search is there   YOUTUBE WORKING Great and D h cable quality depends what plan you opt hd or SD   I have Hd SD both     HD WORK SUPERB AND SD WORK BUT DUE TO SD IT WORKS ACCORDINGLY   Final go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Product is excellent  Quality is awesome  Can see the Oneplus style in the quality  Better picture quality and better sound and better pricing
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Very poor quality tv made by OnePlus  The video quality is not even compared with LCD tv very poor software  Bluetooth mode is also not working properly  Remote is responding only when you pressed its buttons   to   times  Do not waste your money on this go for alternate brands like Realme or TCL  Not wanted to give a single star to this tv but it is mandatory so I gave  
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Picture Quality is ok not much of great experience and remote control is also kind of beta product as several times it is difficult to on and off tv  What I found really bad is sound quality which is low quality and not at all expected experience from OnePlus  I hope they fix in upcoming software update as sound is really bad experience it is not so clear and very bad experience 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Screen issues worst TV do not buy
Smartdevices,1,OR,  When I read the negative comments on the reviews I thought people are expecting   k tv features in   k budget TV  so I thought it would be good for its price range  But when the product got delivered  I realised buying this TV is a mistake Build quality worst you will not feel worth of the money you spent on the TV  Remote control is another disaster Overall  better to go for alternative 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Door delivery has not done  I personally went Amazon store and Tv is ok but remote is not workingYour technician has tell that it will replace Tommorow  but till now I did not received any call from Amazon and brand companyPlease help us to get the remote immediately
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This tv  is perfect and one plus does not need any marketing stunt and this tv price is perfect compare to other tv brands and picture quality is perfect And yes Sony Bravia also comes close to this but I would like to go with one plus value for money  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I am a big fan of one plus  the picture  quality of tv is awesome but sound system would have been better   I am using my logitech bluetooth speaker   I request company to fix this issue   Otherwise   k of our investment would be not wise decision 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   There is no doubt about picture quality it is one plus product  Just go for it  after Apple one plus is the only company has most trustable about quality and performance   I am planning to buy another one on next sale   
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Very disappointed with the product Remote is not getting paired at all  I have tried other bluetooth device to pair but tv not showing anything  I tried many times in different way also but it is same as before 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Good picture Quality      Even on slower net   mobile hotspot we can watch   Youtube   amzon prime vidoo   hotstar contents in good Quality     Audio is good   go with Additional speakers   sound bar    We can install multiple Apps from Play store   Remote is easy to use via Bluetooth is good best feature of this TV Over all good in this price segment  go for it if you want to upgrade ur TV 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using this product since one month and the FHD experience is really amazing  Sound is decent  Vivid mode is not necessary because the standard picture mode gives great colors Pros  bezel less display  great gamut range  good remote controlCon  backlight light is slightly visible when white frames appear   nd image    recommend external sounbars for better sound experience 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I got defective tv unable to connect the wifi and have some remote pairings issue
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Sound quality is poor i e below average   picture quality is whitish little bit as MI tv  more over Amazon is giving worst service after having   slot bookings service person will come and tell that it is not free of cost we need to pay for wall mount stand and that to MI wall mount or else he will regret to come   Then after calling to  Amazon call service center and none will give proper replay very poor service by Amazon they will make us fools by taking complaint  
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Tv looks premium and slim and very light weight Voice it low than usual   Inbuilt speaker is too low even for small room   You need to use extra Bluetooth speaker   But what else you expect in this price  I got this in   k which is serving purpose overall 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Picture quality is too good  Also the gap btwn the display and the outer boundary is a little bit  which looks awesome in full hd  Sound quality is avg  I suggest add a sound bar of boAt  About Posting and packaging I have no words      Just amazing  the remote is inbuilt google voice assistant which helps too much  Overall awesome product  Worth it    
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Worst experience   low quality cheap build   go for vu tv or mi tv for better experience   connectivity is very poor  not even usb port is connecting properly   Google voice assistant is not working  dolby atmos poor cheappp    Worst display panel   blindly purchased tv for the brand OnePlus  but totally disappointed       Not user friendly do not BUY ONEPLUS TV       only OP s smart phones are good not any other gadgets   
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The picture and sound quality is very very good and you can literally purchase it if you look something in this budget than any other brand Works with OnePlus connect  Response speed is also great  However you may face some problem with Chromecast  But overall It is LITERALLY WORTH BUYING
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The product is good   but there are few bugs in oxygen play  Every time you have to pair Bluetooth speaker to connect  which is annoying  You are in unpair  pair device loop often The picture quality and perfomance is best in class  The software experience is seamless  I am expecting these minor bug fixes in software update 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  I am not at all satisfied with the picture quality  also there is a fault in the remote  not at all happy with the product  The TV installation person came when the return window was closed  This is not expected from Amazon  this is disgusting I want to return this product 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The product was enough good for this price segment the only thing which i personally do not like is the sound quality tho there is dolby audio environment there in this the tv the sound Seems to be mixed sound and not clear  The oxygen play is also a good thing in the tv and sometimes the remote seems to be lagging while operating  Although a good and nice tv according to this price segment with amazing video quality
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The TV is perfect in this price range Video quality is very good you can play videos at     p in full HD Smart features are quite excellent One thing that you can see very less bezels and TV is so slim and attractive overall TV IS Excellent but oneplus should improve their speaker sound its not upto the expectation sound improvement should be their 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Loving the picture quality and slim design  Google Voice recognition is perfect  Easy to setup with just voice command  Hope in future I will be able write more on other features 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  The sound quality is not good   not clear at all to understand a conversation While playing YouTube or Prime or any online site  this unclear sound output becomes more difficult to understand 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  it is a good product by oneplus but the main problem was the TV INSTALLATION  Because of the pandemic it is too late for installation of TV so it is better to buy offline rather than buing online
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Speaker quality is horrible Since they have back speakers it should be kept in an open space and not in any kind of closed space or something that has back covered  Also this was not mentioned in the details which is a little disappointing Resolution is okayish feels more of     rather than      Recommended for watching regular movies and shows but not for gaming 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Its having software issue  the date and time changes every time when we switch off the TVI was return and get another one  but it is also same software issue    I do not like this
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Display of the TV is not up to mark    withing    days my TV screen got a dark visible line in center of the display      and customer service is not responding

Smartdevices,1,CG,  One of the worst experience i got from this product  No customer service to help  The TV was lying for almost    days because no one came to install and finally i had to return  Most irresponsible service from one plu 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is good Wonderful display but remember it is full hd display if you come closer you can find noticeSound is good when you change settings into dolb digital but iam getting crackling sound from left speaker   I booked service if they solve the problem no problem otherwise I will go for replacementConnectivity also good only you feel laging when you do screen mirroring through wifi
Smartdevices,5,CG,  I have already read all the reviews and I knew the tv does not sound great but the picture quality is soo good and the brand value of one plus is a plus    at this price point this is the only good brand      Buy a good sound bar and you are good to go I  brought a Samsung n    sound bar 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  I like the TV pretty much The picture and sound quality is the best valued at this price segment But the only problem with the TV is depicted in the second pic i posted  I do not understand why it is happening when i change the channel for two seconds then it comes to normal
Smartdevices,5,CG,  AMAZON DELIVERY IS EXCELLENT BUT THE INSTALLATION SERVICE IS WORST  ONE PLUS TV AT THIS PRICE OF       IS REALLY WORTH RELIANCE DIGITAL SERVICE IS GOOD AND FASTER THAN AMAZON AND THE SERVICE FROM RELIANCE DIGITAL IS EXCELLENT 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  One plus led quality very poor  And bottom beading not proper stick with tv screen so occure focusing issue  We raise the complaint and prob attend by technician  He told this is manufacturer defect comes with one plus led tv always in my home other led tv sony brawia   In this sony tv beading proper fits with body   Technician told me not compare with sony  One plus is a low brand 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  After   month   I am still love to watch tv with OnePlus y series   earlier I wished to brought you series but you series was not available so i have brought Y series  But it is truly love in it   yeah still some bugs are there but I am happy to ignore it   my best experience is swich off the room lights and  tv brightness or tv ground light works good and a glass of  made  my tv experience good  
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Not a good product the software is bad   Bluetooth quality is bad  TV is slow   While working the sound also goes off

Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Exactly after   days screen damaged even service also after complaint nonone resopond from last one wee still waiting    plz do not buy
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Product Good  however Amazon service very very very BAD  Installation done after   days with so many follow ups Poor service support  Service provider changes schedule dates    I have very bad experience with Amazon service by this product  
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Good product   Picture quality is good  surround sound works well Fairly responsive UI Expected awesome picture quality and primium UI quality and responce but it is not there  so did not feel like one plus TV UI clarity is very bad  feel like it is pixelated  but video picture quality is good
Smartdevices,1,OR,  it is a old model tv you cannot get dual band frequency of  the tv and if you need to do any this with picture quality the you will need to stop the movie and then go to service to resolve the issues other brand tv have better features than this old technology
Smartdevices,1,OR,  First of all its not a   inch it is a cut sizeNot working voice recognitionNot looking one plus brand it is defiantly china assemble item only one plus using nameIn my opinion one plus loose ur brand valueIf I compare to realme and miOne plus is less than other product
Smartdevices,1,OR,  So first thing is that you cannot control this TV with the fire stick remotes power and volume buttons  next thing is you cannot even connect it to Alexa  one plus support states that they will release a software update but not sure when  The sound is so bad  even my phone sounds better than this TV 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  The TV is awesome buy for a budget smart TV  Lives up to the reputation of One  Products  Sound output is not that excellent but overall a good product for its price segment  Its definitely good option for a bedroom TV  Its a ideal    inch is good for viewing distance of   ft  If your distance is more than   ft then please prefer a    inch Tv
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Pros    Very good from the price point   Setting up was easyCons    The software has lot of bugs and needs to be fixed    Connect app is very poor  Was never able to use it even from OnePlus phone 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  This product comes with good box packing and delivery boy unbox the tv at the time of delivery The feature of this tv is very good and easy to handle with simple remote and the voice recognisation feature is very good and also with good quality TV picture  
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Oneplus TV have lots of bugsHDMI ARC dnt work properly  Have to restart TV to get it work  Its lags too much No    mm jack Optical port is brokern after some days Bluetooth headset does not connects automatically  Have to unpair and pair again Youtube sometimes crashes Playing videos through media player is annoying  Next video comes while fast forwarding 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Do not buy this product as it is quality is worst There are bugs  small insects  ants  entering into the display and roaming freely inside it  Please see the picture I attached with this review I am trying to contact customer care for last   days but no reply from their side as well  I feel like i have wasted       on this product 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The product is not at all good aa compared to the competitors  I bought a    inch smart tv   For which there waa no installation done   the tv is giving electric shock if you touch it   The remote that came with it is not working  Nd i can not get in touch with anyone  
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Bought a wall mount bracket   it was movable and great by the installation person   Very much kind of him   Even though bracket has to be wall mounted   drilling on wall there was not even a dust on the floor   Installer was using the drilling machine with dust collector 
Smartdevices,1,OR,    there is no wall stand you have to pay extra   if you are installing an new app like airtel xtream or sony live it is not installing i am very frustated now feeling like waste of money    now after    days you can not return it back    guaranty will not work in this installation issue I was wrong i trusted this Chinese tvplease do not buy      
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Product is good but pictury quality is not as expected I feel MI smart tv picture quality is better than this OnePlus Tv  my opinion because some people feel that OnePlus tv picture quality is better than MI tv   Connectivity is good  It runs android   with built in playstore 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Installation services is to bad he was not fixing your septop  and also  i was requesting him sir plz can you fixed the septop boxx and also informing us about products operating details but he straightly telling no i am here for open and fix the but  he  is misser  and also  tv speed is too much slow but viewing quality is amazing and etc thing s is also good but installation services is  useless 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  this product is good  light weight  thin and i m totally satisfied with there picture quality   may be a little improvement is required with sound but overall product quality is good 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Never go for it  I was a OnePlus fan and I am totally disappointed  The tv display panel has some issues within one month of purcahse  It has a red tint kind of thing on the screen  I waited for a long time to buy the tv from OnePlus and this is I get 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Tried every settings  but audio is not crystal  as mentioned  Bezel less display is dope though 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   has power button problem with in   month when switching on in the remote it is not switching on after several attempts it is switching on
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Picture quality is good and sound quality is very poor  Remote control is very slow in connecting 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  the  product is worth of buying  the price of the tv is  comes around      k   comparing to the other brand   one plus gives standard and quality  product  I am giving this review after one year the warranty period is over and  still there is no problem with product  amazon provided the installation on the same day of delivery   I appreciate  amazon for it    
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The TV is very good to have as a secondary TV  The sound is great and the remaining qualities are simply superb    The picture quality is really good for a    Inch TV and the Bezel Free design gives it a great look  Once the remote is connected  there is no problem with the voice recognition or the controlling    Overall a great product for very less price  Must Buy
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Very disappointing with this new product of One plus   Because screen not appear issue found within   months of purchase  And the service is poor   service center not available at nearby Guys do not waist ur money to buy this  Buy samsung  sony tv
Smartdevices,1,CG,  whenever i try to enter the wifi password i am not able to enter it and i am not even getting an on display keyboard had to use a separate keyboard  And whenever i click on google assistant the bluetooth window pops open and it shows searching for accesories
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Sound quality bis not good comparing with same segment led    w sound is a joke 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Nyc product I have been using one plus   for last   yrs and i m very satisfied with the quality that one plus offers and this smart tv form one plus is also good
Smartdevices,2,OR,  This One plus LED tv gets hanged every time  Its not worth bying it  Sound is also not audible  Please go for Mi LED tv instead as I am using Mi oed tv  a pro too since last   years  But purchased One plus tv just    days ago and hanging problem is since then only 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Good Android TV in the price range with decent picture quality and good sound quality  Impressed with the installation service by VECARE  The walmount was not a part of the package  however got it for free as a part of the free installation  The serviceman were v polite and professional  Amazon  like Flipkart  should work on better extended warranty deals  The Flipkart one is quite a deal at     for   extra years 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  One Plus perfect choice with reasonable price and good picture quality is best i am happy with this purchase  Amazon in service is excellent second day delivery 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Could not have asked for more in this price  The tv is perfect just as one would expect from a OnePlus Device But it is  better to get a soundbar with it for amazing sound 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Interface issuesLags so muchScreen cast taking too much time to connectApart from above issues  overall product is good within this price range

Smartdevices,5,CG,  Just got the TV delivered  A great product in    inch segment from the brand  Sound quality is good  Picture quality is superb as well  Remote is very smooth  Easy to set up by self  Build quality is also very good  Worth buying it as a entry level product  The only flaw i had witnessed is only HDMI port   support audio output 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Decent sound  Picture is good for that price  Fast software update  No     mm jack is a disappointment  Missing     nits HDR

Smartdevices,5,CG,  TV is awsm  sound quality for a single room is satisfied but for hall you should go for you series   The only problem is that remote is completely black along with buttons so maximum of time you have to look the button and than press otherwise wrong key get s pressed  Minor one but I suggest remote button should be little more gripable rather than being flat with the surface
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Very good product oneplus TV

Smartdevices,4,OR,  Excellent Display  The sound quality could be better though  Initially the TV lagged a lot while setting up Netflix and Youtube  After a few hours  it is now working fine  though it does lag a bit sometimes possibly due to a slow processor

Smartdevices,4,CG,  Everything is ok as per price   and moreover compare b w realme tv and one plus the experience was superb at one plus tv   in both tv sound quality was a minor difference as quality of picture   oneplus is good from my experience  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Completely satisfied with the purchase  I like ths picture quality and bezel less display a lot Dolby digital sound works great  You do not need to go beyond     volume in a medium room because it is loud enough  Remote control has a minimalist design so easy to use  Works great on WiFi

Smartdevices,1,CG,  Pathetic Panel from OnePlus  We can easily detect screen bleeding on brighter videos  Remote also does not work most of the times  Sound quality is more worse   We can not understand most of the dialogues  It lags most of the times due to its  GB RAM  Not recommended for anyone  Please do not buy  They are fooling people with features 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Oneplus has come up with this smart tv as very low cost and as per the picture   sound quality it is amazing  Only drawback i found in it is that there is no option available to set picture or sound quality  It will be default and depend upon your connection  Due to this you get sharp colors and the base of sound is also very low 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Best tv under       rs   one plus tv is best for buget  Piture quality superbAudio output is some time okRemote control superbBut installation is very bed and poor guy servince in digicare I am oder    july and delever my oder in   day

Smartdevices,4,OR,  The TV was delivered on time but installation took more than   hrs which was   hrs beyond the schedule I saw while placing the order  I felt it would have been better if there is some coordination between Seller and installation team so that I could have contacted technician directly after delivery of TV but it did not materialize

Smartdevices,1,OR,  Bought the thing in the first sale  worked about    hrs and    mins of total watchtime and then boom stopped working would not get on remote stopped working  complained and booked repair took   days for a technician for checking and then    days for the repair in which motherboard was changed  again worked for a total of   hours and    minutes and boom again stopped working  I do not know what ppl are talking about the product and service  Believe me not worth it  Even low prices just create you lots of hassle nd you cannot even njoy what you paid for  Buy a black nd white instead it will still work better than this junk  So anyone trying to buy it just read this pls  It may save you a lot of trouble  If you do not believe me just write a reply and I will hook you up with all my emails and complaints 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  it is been more than   weeks Iam waiting for this tv sales on Amazon but every day whenever I check for the availability it shows  next sale date will be announced soon   it is not such a great tv compared to other options available in the market  realme  mi vu   But just because I own a OnePlus mobile I wanted to buy this tv  But lost my patients in waiting for the sales of this tv now and Iam going to buy realme which is available at same price in Flipkart  Thank you amazon
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Pre ordered the TV before product launch Got the delivery and installation done on time post launch First week  HDMI ports stop working  Firestick  Tata Sky could not be used Second week  Colour display goes off in   weeks and everything turns black and white   months now  No resolution of the complaint nor is the unit replaced  Customer service is supposed to be Amazon itself for this brand but everything is outsourced and the quality of the franchise operations is really awful  Horrible and pathetic service by Amazon customer service as well  When you are launching something as a flagship tv  you might as well get your post order processes in order  Its really not a pleasant experience when my parents are stupefied by the experience and ask me Is this really the global giant Amazon that you ordered from  and why I did not get it from the local shop instead 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good
Smartdevices,5,OR,  it is a good product at the price range Better than Mi tv  a or the Mi horizon edition Bezzels are really thin  compared with pencil Sound quality is great Picture quality is also good Oxygen play Chromecast built in  other apps work flawlessly Remote is quite handy also the OnePlus connect app works handy if remote not around No physical button on off button on the tv  so if remote goes haywire then you will face some issues Good viewing for  bhk rooms or more as viewing angle is great Connects with basic wifi    GHz too Out of  Gb some     gb available for usage which is enough for all purposes Can connect with cable or dish tv Warranty on product is   yr and on panel is  yr Takes only       kWh units of electrical consumption annualy and has     power saving quality with BEE certification Wall Mount not included  you need to purchase at Rs     from the install guys No waiting for installation as delivery guys do the needful Overall a good product       stars 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The video quality of this tv is a big issue   i am highly disappointed by it  I have done screen to screen comparison running  K video on OnePlus TV with local entry level TV sets  To my surprise entry level TV has slightly better HD    K resolution experience  I also came to know from the offline market that its spare parts are also not easily available if tv dysfunctions someday    Better buy mid level Brand instead if budget is restriction 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Picture Quality is goodSound was ugly when in TV top but improved when mounted on wall  recommended to wall mountGor it in   k only and amazon gave free installation the next day Little lags came after installing an appHuge lags came after installing more than   apps so you need to rely on pre installed apps and not to install anything else for better performanceWorks with every bluetooth headphones and earplugsOverall  Good Product 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  One Plus is eroding it is brand value generated through mobile and marketing gimmick my launching rejected cheap chinese TV products  Actually here is when you can differentiate Japanese and Chinese Products  The core is Ethics    Japanese and Korians deliver what promise   Chinese just market and fail on delivery
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Pros    price is decentCons   poor sound quality      voice control is basically for youtube only      picture quality is also poor not upto     FHD      Zee  app not working in my device      Normal SD channels quality is too poor  We are using sony bravia FULL HD led after that we use this oneplus tv but this is not satisfiing product from oneplus   i will recommend you to purchase the non branded indian assembled led tv which cost you almost      less than this TV   Thank you
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Only the picture quality is good Sound   need to use the product with low volume and if you increase the volume you will get broken sound and other disturbances Oxygen Play  not pre installed  When I called the customer service team they are saying that I need to install it feom playstore and use it as an app  And also the oxygen play is not for the y series TV s as it is cheaper compared to other TV s Performance   poor performance it is very much slow and also when ever I click something on remote it reacts after    seconds Remote   even after the remote getting paired with the TV it uses infrared to turn on and in some cases it is not getting turned on with remote and you need to press the button on the tv manually which is so much irritatingKids mode   not availableOk Google   it does not listen to voice commands 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  do not buy it because the after sales service and the Amazon service is too bad    my Tv display went bad in the  th month and today its the   th day the one plus company and Amazon still have not done anything about it    and they do not even have a definite answer to when they will fix it    Amazon  oneplustv
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Installation team dosen t have knowledge of remote pairing  totally dissatisfied with installation appointment timing  I received tv   days before still I am unable to use tv just because of remote not pairing due to lack of experience of installer send by amazone approved team  Till date I suffer for remote not paired  when I call to amazone care he set rescheduling for installation process he again gave appointment date  I wait for haul day but till no buddy come for Reinstall when I call to installer person he said to operate which I say on call and try I will not come for visit so I try to pair remote by given instructions from he said still not paired  so he says me I can not help you kindly replace or return your tv Very poor service provide by installation provider at every time I call him  not a single time he call me like a uninterested WORK of install team 
Smartdevices,4,OR,  The cons first  Not great quality but not noticeable when viewing  If quality matters to you  get a better TV  If accessibility at low cost matters to you  then this TV is perfect The android OS works well enough  it is familiar and with Chromecast built in  you can cast to the screen with multiple devices super easily You can use a USB device to watch videos  Only install a file manager and VLC from the Google play store app If it works on Android  it works on your TV The TV is super light  so mounting it is a no brainer  The bezels are very thin for such a low budget TV 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Excellent product  Picture quality was amazing  Quite disappointed with the sound quality compare to my samsung    inch TV  But over all good product from a leading brand with this budget  I was bit afraid by seeing few negative reviews but later I satisfied with the product  OnePlus is Slimmest bezel less TV in this segment 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Ok
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Have had this TV for about   weeks now  here are my thoughts Pros Great punchy coloursDeep blacksLoud speakersGood customer serviceCons The speakers are loud and flat  that is it  Dolby does not make a difference  surround sound option makes it sound worse Remote has limited functionality  have to go back and forth apps to adjust brightness and other stuff Neat UI  but is very laghu understandable at this price  but since remote does not have alot of built in controls  it is a hassle to change settingsOne plus app still does not have keyboard option  have to use on screen keyboard One plus app is pretty basic wished that atleast that had more options For some reason refuses to screen cast from some phones Conclusion  great TV but mediocre SMART TV  go for this if you plan to use limited apps and do not mind the slow loading  Cheers hope it helps
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I am giving you   star because there is no option to give you zero  I have purachsed a    inch tv on    Jan and it was installed on     After    minutes of woking  the screen became blank and sound was coming  One complaint was registered on the same day  On   th technician came and at that time tv was working properly  Again half an hour tv became blank  Another complaint was registered on    Jan to replace the tv  Till now I have made number of calls in this regard  After two weeks of time  the customer care informed me that my tv replacement is approved and it will take another week to replace it   There is no value for the customers  If been    days that i made my complaint   So upset with the support given by one plus team   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  With the previous software I used to face lot of problems  but now with the new software update all the problems have been rectified and it is smooth sailing  audio quality has been improved very well and also it feels faster than before  One thing to bear in mind is that sometimes it does not turn on with the remote  so you will have to switch it on with the the power button behind the TV 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  The quality of the picture is not good if you really want to buy this tv before buying please visit to your nearest electronic shop and see the picture quality and compare it with other tv you will not buy it  QLed is best if you want to buy that you can go for it 
Smartdevices,2,OR,  Got The One plus Y series TV in the  st sale thinking it would be great but i was really disappointed after using it for a week Pros    Picture quality is Good    Google assistant works Fine that is it for prosCons    Laggy UI  hangs multiple times    Takes     clicks to power on the TV with  remote      Gb RAM is there but it is not properly  optimised so it takes about a lot of time to  switch between apps    Pathetic Audio Quality    The volume increases upto     on the  volume control and that is full volume after  that only the bar moves forward but volume  remains the same    No HDMI Arc support to pair external  soundbar 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  it is disappointing to see that with all those marketing about sound quality   sound was certainly not the best feature of the TV  It certainly needs to be improved along with the build quality  The picture quality is not that great for the    P Model  I would recommend going for at least the full Hd model if you can  But I can not complain much given the price range  I certainly expected to see the Oneplus magic  that their every other product has 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  The Tv is really good we had a sony bravia a normal tv and wanted to buy a smart tv for our room so as to watch netflix prime and so on   We love the quality it is really good   there are no problems in the tv  We bought a oneplus tv because oneplus is a great and trustworthy company and immediately responds to everyone is complanits if any on time    My husband and I both have oneplus phones and looking at how good  the phone is working and the amazing features the phone had   we were fixed on buying the tv   I would highly recommeded it to people who like best quality for a less price 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I have been using OnePlus Y     Tv from the month of September       I had actually been waiting for the TV to be launched  The slimness of the TV makes it more stunning  Sound effect is quite good and is sufficient for a moderate sized living room  The connectivity between Alexa and OnePlus is the unique feature which I personally like The colors are great  mainly watching a high quality movie on TV is a visual treat for eyes  Phone and TV connectivity makes it more easy to use  Overall experience with the TV is fabulous  I would suggest everyone to buy it 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   I am writing this review after    daysThe picture quality is super and sound is awesome and remote control is some what lag and the tv also lag some time but tv is super and the delivery is also nice but the installation was worst that installation idiotWas broken hdmi cable and he said     for wall mount in call but he had changed the word and took     rupees The hdmi cable was worth     Rupees overall      rupees was wasted he had fixed tv dirtuly and made our home worst OnePlus    Y  series  tv is awesome that idiot installation was worst that bleady rascal
Smartdevices,3,CG,  TV is great  Great picture quality One thing I noticed is there is lot of lag during screen cast Also OnePlus connect on OnePlus mobile mostly do not find OnePlus tv Installation was done well  The person charged Rs     for wall mount bracket  And  free installation
Smartdevices,1,OR,  I have   one plus TV sets at home all are worst  Very disappointed with the quality  The unit it self functions automatically without any human intervention  It starts slows it takes    mins to starts like old windows machine  Some times it works like ROBOT automatically ON OFF  it takes me to YouTube  Amazon prime  Netflix etc   Remote does not work properly  Its one of the worst product one plus   After multiple complaints they do not turn up to resolve the issue  pathetic service very disappointed customer   pls do not buy this product 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Great buy  Excellent navigation  Great connectivity  Must have for modern home  Do not miss the opportunity  Go for it  I am very happy to own it  All my friends and family enjoy a lot  They are always glued to it
Smartdevices,1,CG,  it is one of the worst television I have purchased in my life its got horrible sound system where you can not hear the sound properly secondly picture quality is also ok third sometimes when the tv is on automatically prime or you tube starts it is so irritating my advise never buy it 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Avoid buying one plus tv as almost every tv has some or the other display issues    Mine got no display in a month time      and now no reponse other than an automated response from their team sayin will be resolved soon 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am posting this review after using product for  months  Features and specifications of this product is so good  Easy to use the features and video clearity is also amazing  I use this product as my Desktop for WFH and really appreciate the product quality do not waste your time in searching other products and comparing with other products if you really want some good stuff to be hanged on the wall of your living room then go for one plus 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  This tv is a masterpiece from one plus in context with the price  full hd display with top notch sound quality  no lag and is easy to use  My only problem is with tv remote  its giving me issues  i have replaced the batteries thrice  still the problem persists  otherwise its a good tv  even i enjoy gaming     only one plus should update the software regularly to avoid bugs and other issues     
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Bought y   one plus tv  tv does not connect to internet  and sound quality is very bad  Tv looks good the model looks premium but software still lags  It was laggy already before i even installed any apps as the tv s wifi was not working  Returned the tv got the refund 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Not even a penny worth got problem with hdmi ports within    days thaught that it was problem with the dish box so i did not use for   month again dish mechanic came from d h and checjed and told that problem with the hdmi ports called oneplus customer care told my problems  i asked for replacement but they did not accept they were stubborn with their side please go for redmi tv its good and they will give   year replacement warranty  
Smartdevices,5,CG,  The bottomline is  OnePlus  TV does not look bad  In fact  colours are quite good and if you can bring high quality content  you will have a field day  But it will not quite be as much fun as the Sony A G  And the picture quality is not good enough to justify spending an extra    or    grand over a Mi  Vu or TCL AndroidTV 
Smartdevices,3,CG,  Was So exited to have this tv and had a great disappointmentTotally unexpected with oneplusThis kind of new products are being shipped from oneplusDisplay pixel dead from upper right cornerPower button on the is not working
Smartdevices,2,CG,  We received the product with tampered packaging  After the delivery  setting up was not a big deal but the TV did not switch on  It turned on only once after that it just did not switch on  The power supply was apt  even the technician marked the product as defected  Amazons service response was very slow after the date of purchase we were issued the replacement after one week 
Smartdevices,3,OR,  Wall Mount not given into the box do not buy this product ur face several problems after buying these  service boy worst behaviour  Tv installed like up and down  I called him but he cennot giving my reply 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Everything was fine for   month but turn out to be complaint then  screen started to flicker and can not be used as of now  I did not expected such an experience from one plus  Very disappointed   I had installed the tv by my own because the customer service did not approached me for installing until now  Everyone please think thrice before its buy because one month was its working period 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Amazing TV for a bedroom and amazing features that eases my usage and worth the money I paid   Picture quality and sound output is amazing  User interface is super smooth and overall a great experience with the TV
Smartdevices,2,OR,  it is OK product  There are many alternatives like Samsung or Thompson which are better than this  it is of Chinese origin so it is doubtful that it will work well for a long time given the duplicate products which China manufactures and sells cheap products like this 
Smartdevices,1,OR,  do not buy this tv  Worst service of oneplus  and also do not buy alexa device because it is not supporting oneplus tv  Amazon is making fool that alexa is supported but its just to sell their product  Really fed up  Very disappointing  Lagging problem and sometimes remote does not work  Power on timing is very delay 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  The quality was bad and led screen was bad quility And tha customer support was not answer correctlyI refer to jot buy this tv
Smartdevices,5,CG,  great tv with smart feature oneplus is brand that people can trust with love packaging was good and installation was hassel free
Smartdevices,1,OR,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Damaged TV colourColour tune damagedFake qualityOne plus one plus is duplicated sale on items Amazon      d    us

Smartdevices,3,OR,  This tv did not met our expectations first of all  Chromecast was very laggy  no proper Oxygen Play  sound clarity was below average  photo sharing not supported yet  This tv is of very cheap quality   Expected a premium   inch TV from oneplus  All the competitors are providing all the features  Nothing special from oneplus
Smartdevices,4,OR,  I have been using OnePlus TV for past few months and here are my impressions  What is good    Premium Bezel less Design   Best in Class Picture Quality   Impressive Colour reproduction   Excellent Screen Brightness   Usable remote with ergonomic design   Dedicated buttons for Netflix  Prime Video  Google Assistant and OxygenPlay   Clean OxygenPlay interface What could have been Better    There are some occasional hiccups while using  does not turn on sometimes with remote  Live TV output does not detect after quick restart etc which could be possibly fixed by an update  some issues are already fixed   Sound quality is just above average  nothing to be bragged about  It is noticeable specially in lows and dialogues which lacks clarity  Bass is below average  The Dolby audio processing was not noticeable    Google Voice Assistant is occasionally unresponsive for certain voice commands but could be fixed by a software update    Performance is good and similar to the alternatives available in the market  but not at the expected OnePlus benchmark    OxygenPlay needs much refinement in terms of speed and UI   Additional Technical Specifications   Dimension   TV Without Stand                 mmVerdict Design      Build      Display      Sound      Remote      Software      Experience      Overall     Considering it as the first generation Y series product  appreciating OnePlus for doing a good job in providing the maximum value for money device at this price range If you do not own a smart TV yet and looking forward for an affordable value for money offering  OnePlus TV   Y  is a definite recommendation 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  I am not sure about the negative comments here  I am writing this review after   days of receiving this Tv and I would say that it is pretty decent  I bought it in Great India sale at     k and I believe I am getting what I paid for  In fact it is worth every penny  Love it is features and HD is beyond amazing  I must say  it is quality is better than the one of Samsung and Thomson priced at   k   Oneplus never disappoints me I will update after one month of usage 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Worst quantity do not go with brandMI is than this and very bad customer serviceDon t fall in hype and be active to search on the other do not buy this product and not recommended
Smartdevices,4,OR,  GoodModern  industrial designGood picture quality across resolutionsVery good motion interpolation settingsAccurate colours  good contrastExcellent software and remoteBadPoor black levelsInconsistent soundAftermarket wall mount kits do not fit properly
Smartdevices,4,OR,  Its not too big and it is medium size would help people who have space constraints  The picture is quite good but  the sound need clarity  One problem that I face with this is I can not seem to install other apps from playstore on the tv 
Smartdevices,5,OR,  A tv for   k   that too smart tv   dream comes true  Enjoying this tv from past   month   no issues faced in resolution   not the best resolution but a good one  Sometimes facing lag issues on starting of the TV   but after usage of   to    minute never faced any lag  Easing through amzon prime netflix and youtube like a rocket 
Smartdevices,4,CG,  Picture quality is good  Remote is beautiful but has a range issue  you need to keep at a certain degree for it to operate  Sound quality is below average  you would have to get speakers for better sound quality 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Good quality but cannot download all apps like Sony  But  good   cheap 
Smartdevices,1,CG,  Your browser does not support HTML  video   Worst product  do not go for it 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Awesome Product Picture  voice everything i loved it   
Smartdevices,5,CG,  Nice picture and sound quality value for money and reasonable price 
Smartdevices,5,CG,  According to me sound quality  and  mm jack is not available Rest of the things are perfect     Go for it   
Smartdevices,5,OR,  Exellent android tv and good picture quality with best priceGo for it
